What better way to round off the year than with the release of __CARLA 0.9.11?__

{% include youtube.html id="2c-KlQ8SFcc" %}

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.9.11" %}

In this release there has been a big focus on improving __determinism__, with the goal of
making CARLA more reliable and stable. __Traffic Manager__ can now be used in full deterministic mode, and even
the animations used in pedestrian collisions (__rag dolls__) are deterministic by default.

__CARLA 0.9.11__ brings many fixes and updates of critical features. The __PhysX Vehicle Manager__ has been
enhanced to provide more realistic wheel rolling physics and accurate collisions.
We have extended the maps API  to provide the ability to toggle on and off every environment object individually. We also have
__new versions of all our maps__, in which users can load and unload the different
elements of the map by layers. The [__ROS
bridge__](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge) has plenty of improvements too, most notably the ability to spawn new pseudo sensors, which
allows the user to visualize and collect ground truth data.

There have been several new additions to the CARLA ecosystem too. We are proud to present the
new integration of [__CarSim__](https://www.carsim.com/) (in beta). This is a powerful and high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulator
that allows users to perform realistic vehicle dynamics simulation of a specific vehicle model.  
We are also excited to announce the integration of the [__Scenic__](https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/Scenic) traffic scenario specification
language (in beta). And finally, we have added __four new vehicle models__ to the blueprint library!  

Here's a rundown of the features that come with CARLA 0.9.11:

* __[Improved PhysX Vehicle Manager](#improved-physx-vehicle-manager)__ - Sweep collision
  control improves the wheel rolling physics of our fleet of vehicles.
* __[Map Sublevels](#map-sublevels)__ -  We created new optimized versions of our maps (tagged 
  with the "Opt" suffix) that can be loaded and unloaded in a layer-by-layer fashion.
* __[Toggle Environment Objects](#toggle-environment-objects)__ - Each object of the environment (asset)
   can be enabled and disabled in runtime.
* __[Deterministic Traffic Manager](#deterministic-traffic-manager)__ - Traffic Manager is now fully deterministic.
* __[Deterministic Rag Doll Animations](#deterministic-rag-doll-animations)__ -  Pedestrian-vehicle 
  collisions are deterministic by default.
* __[New Vehicles](#new-vehicles)__ - Four new vehicles added to the blueprint library.
* __[Synchronous Mode Pipeline Update](#synchronous-mode-pipeline-update)__ - An updated 
  pipeline to fix delay in client server response times in synchronous mode.  
* __[CarSim Integration (Beta)](#carsim-integration-beta)__ - Support for co-simulation using CarSim (in beta), providing high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation.
* __[Scenic Support (Beta)](#scenic-support-beta)__ - Support for  Scenic, a domain-specific 
  traffic scenario language capable of generating challenging traffic situations in a few lines of code.
* __[ROS Bridge Improvements](#ros-bridge-improvements)__ - Spawn and destroy actors via ROS
  services, generate pseudo sensors, new passive mode and integration of DVS camera, and semantic
  LIDAR.

## Improved PhysX Vehicle Manager

The model controlling the interaction between vehicles' wheels and surfaces has been upgraded,
fixing an important problem that was causing wheels to intersect solid objects. Users will now have the option
to use a new model, based on sweep collision control. Sweep collision control allows for
all possible contact planes along the wheel to be considered and thus ensure a smoother drive
over obstacles and bumps in the scene. No more sudden jumps nor sinking into the curb!

![sweep_wheels](/img/posts/2020-12-22/wheels_smallest.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Sweep collision control can be  enabled  using the following code:

```py
physics_control = vehicle.get_physics_control()
physics_control.use_sweep_wheel_collision = True
vehicle.apply_physics_control(physics_control)
```

You can get started straight away with the [manual_control.py](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/PythonAPI/examples/manual_control.py) example script.

Read more about the PhysX implementation of sweep queries [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/physx/guide/Manual/Vehicles.html#wheel-contact-beyond-raycasts).

## Map Sublevels

New versions of all our maps have been released and boast some additional features. The new maps
(identified with the suffix "Opt") have the same layout as previous ones but they are now divided
into sublevels. This
allows users to [load](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.World.load_map_layer)
and [unload](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.World.load_map_layer) maps
layer by layer, providing additional control over the performance of the simulation. The [available layers](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api#carla.MapLayer) are as follows:

* __NONE__ - No layers selected.
* __Buildings__ - Sublevel containing all the buildings on the map.
* __Decals__ - Sublevel containing all the decals on the map.
* __Foliage__ - Sublevel containing all the foliage on the map.
* __ParkedVehicles__ - Sublevel containing all the parked vehicles on the map.
* __Particles__ - Sublevel containing all the particles on the map.
* __Props__ - Sublevel containing all the props on the map.
* __StreetLights__ - Sublevel containing all the streetlights on the map.
* __Walls__ - Sublevel containing all the walls on the map.
* __All__ - All layers selected.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <small><i><strong>Warning! </strong>Sublevels are only available in the "Opt" suffixed maps</i></small>
</div>

## Toggle Environment Objects

Users can now toggle individual environment objects in both old and new maps. Each [object](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.EnvironmentObject)
in the environment has a unique ID that can be [fetched](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.World.get_environment_objects) and used to turn that object [off
and on](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.World.enable_environment_objects).

![toggle_objects](/img/posts/2020-12-22/objects_small.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

## Deterministic Traffic Manager

Users will now have the option to use Traffic Manager in deterministic mode. This will allow
Traffic Manager to have the exact same output over distinct executions of a script as long as
the same conditions are maintained. Deterministic mode is easily turned on by providing an arbitrary seed value to the following
[method](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.TrafficManager.set_random_device_seed):

```
my_tm.set_random_device_seed(seed_value)
```

The most important thing to keep in mind when using deterministic mode with Traffic Manager is
that __both the world and Traffic Manager must be in synchronous mode__ to function properly. It is not
possible to achieve determinism in asynchronous mode due to the reduced amount of control this
mode allows the client over the simulation. Read more about synchrony in CARLA and how to activate it [for the
world](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/#setting-synchronous-mode)
and for [Traffic Manager](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_traffic_manager/#synchronous-mode).

## Deterministic Rag Doll Animations

Collisions with pedestrians trigger a set of animations to simulate damage. Traditionally,
these animations have been directly controlled by Unreal Engine, which introduced a source
of stochasticity. In this new version of CARLA we take direct control of the rag doll animations,
making them deterministic by default. Deterministic rag dolls can be toggled via
the [`deterministic_ragdolls`](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.WorldSettings.deterministic_ragdolls) variable in
the `carla.WorldSettings` class. When set to true, pedestrians have less realistic death animation
but determinism is ensured. When false, simulation and collision are more realistic but
determinism is not ensured.

![rag_dolls](/img/posts/2020-12-22/ragdolls.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

## New Vehicles

CARLA's showroom now boasts 4 new vehicles! This brings the total number of available vehicles in the
[blueprint library](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bp_library#vehicle) up to 31. With these latest additions you
can now take a spin in our brand new Lincoln MKZ 2020, Mercedes-Benz Class C Coupe (by Fran Ruiz), Dodge
Charger 2020 (by Mart√≠n Danlos) and Dodge Police Vehicle! These vehicles have been designed using new materials,
with the goal of increasing the visual quality of the models.

![stills_cars](/img/posts/2020-12-22/stills_cars.jpg){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

## Synchronous Mode Pipeline Update

We have developed an updated synchronisation pipeline that improves server-client communication and 
removes the frame delay present in previous versions.

###### Old synchronisation pipeline:

![old_sync](/img/posts/2020-12-22/old_pipeline.jpeg){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}


###### New synchronisation pipeline:

![new_sync](/img/posts/2020-12-22/new_pipeline.jpeg){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

As shown in the above diagrams, we have changed the key moments in which synchronisation between the client 
and the server happens, providing a much quicker response from the client to the server. In the old 
pipeline, the client's computations were based on the server's information from the previous frame. 
This introduced a delay in the ability of the client to interact with the server. In the new 
pipeline, the input from the client is processed just before the physics
computation. This, alongside the much earlier sensor rendering/computation, allows the client to 
respond in real-time and affect the server directly in the next frame.

## CarSim Integration (Beta)

We are happy to announce the beta integration between CARLA and CarSim. [CarSim](https://www.carsim.com/products/carsim/index.php)
is a simulation tool from Mechanical Simulation that performs highly accurate simulation of the dynamic behavior of passenger
vehicles and light-duty trucks. Using a 3D multi-body dynamics model, it reproduces the physics
of a vehicle in response to different controls (steering, throttle, braking, gear shifting) from
a driver and/or automatic agent. This integration enables co-simulation between CarSim and CARLA, allowing
users to create CarSim vehicles, taking control over dozens of parameters, including suspension 
system, tires, and many more. 

This first integration is great news for users of both CARLA and CarSim as it paves the way for the
most powerful features of both platforms to be combined. Multiple vehicle simulations with collision
capability on complex maps can be run in CARLA and then data can easily be analysed with CarSim's highly
specialised vehicle dynamics tools.

![carsim](/img/posts/2020-12-22/carsim.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

If you are interested in learning more about CarSim before using it
with CARLA, they have a great [2 part introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9EeGjy9uZc) to the tool on their YouTube channel.

## Scenic Support (Beta)

We are also proud to announce the integration of the Scenic programming language in CARLA. [Scenic](https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/Scenic) is a domain-specific probabilistic programming
language specifically created to easily define traffic scenarios. Our ongoing collaboration with the Scenic team
will allow for straightforward definition and execution of traffic scenarios using CARLA. As part of the advantages of Scenic,
we would like to highlight the capability of creating multiple and diverse instances of the same scenario from a single scenario definition.
This will help users to focus on the generation of new traffic scenarios, reducing the amount of effort required to create variations of
an existing one.

Below, there is a code snippet of [Traffic Scenario 03](https://leaderboard.carla.org/scenarios/)
from the CARLA Autonomous Driving Leaderboard created with Scenic. Here we are using Scenic to create a situation
where a pedestrian crosses the road unexpectedly and the ego vehicle is required to react safely.   

```py
# SET SCENARIO PARAMETERS AND MODEL
param map = localPath('../../../tests/formats/opendrive/maps/CARLA/Town01.xodr')
param carla_map = 'Town01'
model scenic.simulators.carla.model  # Here the definitions of all referenceables are defined (vehicle types, road library, etc)

# SCENARIO CONSTANTS
EGO_MODEL = "vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017"
EGO_SPEED = 10
SAFETY_DISTANCE = 10
BRAKE_INTENSITY = 1.0

PEDESTRIAN_MIN_SPEED = 1.0
THRESHOLD = 18

# BEHAVIORS:
behavior EgoBehavior(speed=10):
    try:
        do FollowLaneBehavior(target_speed=speed)
    interrupt when withinDistanceToObjsInLane(self, SAFETY_DISTANCE):
        take SetBrakeAction(BRAKE_INTENSITY)

behavior PedestrianBehavior(min_speed=1, threshold=10):
    do CrossingBehavior(ego, min_speed, threshold)

## DEFINING SPATIAL RELATIONS
lane = Uniform(*network.lanes)

spot = OrientedPoint on lane.centerline
vending_spot = OrientedPoint following roadDirection from spot for -3

# ACTOR CREATION
pedestrian = Pedestrian right of spot by 3,
    with heading 90 deg relative to spot.heading,
    with regionContainedIn None,  # Allow the actor to spawn outside the driving lanes
    with behavior PedestrianBehavior(PEDESTRIAN_MIN_SPEED, THRESHOLD)

vending_machine = VendingMachine right of vending_spot by 3,
    with heading -90 deg relative to vending_spot.heading,
    with regionContainedIn None  # Allow the actor to spawn outside the driving lanes

ego = Car following roadDirection from spot for Range(-30, -20),
    with blueprint EGO_MODEL,
    with behavior EgoBehavior(EGO_SPEED)

# REQUIREMENTS
require (distance to intersection) > 30
require (distance from vending_machine to intersection) > 30
require always (ego.laneSection._slowerLane is None)
require always (ego.laneSection._fasterLane is None)

# TERMINATION CONDITION
terminate when (distance to spot) > 30
```

Execution of the script is easy and you can see some command line options in the Scenic
documentation [here](https://scenic-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/options.html#command-line-options).
The following is an example of how we can run the above script:  

```shell
scenic carlaChallenge3_dynamic.scenic --simulate
```


![scenic](/img/posts/2020-12-22/scenic.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Watch this space for updates and improvements on our integration with Scenic and in the meantime,
take a dive into the Scenic [syntax](https://scenic-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax_details.html)
and explore all the possibilities!

## ROS Bridge Improvements

There have been quite a few improvements made to the ROS Bridge-CARLA experience. A new internal
structure has been developed to ease the integration of the ROS bridge with external tools. Actors can
 now be spawned and destroyed using ROS services, so we have added the [`SpawnObject`](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-carla-msgs/blob/master/srv/SpawnObject.srv) and [`DestroyObject`](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-carla-msgs/blob/master/srv/DestroyObject.srv)
services. Now that actors can be spawned and destroyed in this manner, users can
define pseudo sensors. Pseudo sensors are much like normal sensors but instead of existing in the CARLA
context they are developed directly in the ROS Bridge. This extension brings  much more control over the
data collection process, as each user can define exactly what [pseudo sensors](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge#pseudo-sensors)
they want to use.  

The pseudo sensors available are:
* `sensor.pseudo.actor_list`
* `sensor.pseudo.markers`
* `sensor.pseudo.objects`
* `sensor.pseudo.odom`
* `sensor.pseudo.opendrive_map`
* `sensor.pseudo.speedometer`
* `sensor.pseudo.tf`
* `sensor.pseudo.traffic_lights`

Here is an example of how pseudo sensors can be defined:

```
{
    "objects":
    [
        {
            "type": "sensor.pseudo.opendrive_map",
            "id": "map"
        },
        {
            "type": "vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017",
            "id": "ego_vehicle",
            "sensors":
            [
                {
                    "type": "sensor.camera.rgb",
                    "id": "rgb_front",
                    "spawn_point": {"x": 2.0, "y": 0.0, "z": 2.0, "roll": 0.0, "pitch": 0.0, "yaw": 0.0},
                    "image_size_x": 800, "image_size_y": 600
                },
                {
                    "type": "sensor.pseudo.tf",
                    "id": "tf"
                },
                {
                    "type": "sensor.pseudo.objects",
                    "id": "objects"
                }
             ]
         }
    ]
}
```

We have added a passive mode to the ROS Bridge to ease the integration of external tools
when having multiple CARLA clients running at the same time. When enabling this mode, the ROS
bridge stays passive and other clients have the responsibility of ticking and configuring the world.

Finally in the ROS improvements, the DVS Camera and the Semantic LIDAR are now fully integrated in
the ROS-Bridge.
