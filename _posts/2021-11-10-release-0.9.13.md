The __0.9.13 release of CARLA__ is finally here, so read on to see how the new improvements are going to boost your work. 

CARLA 0.9.13 brings a host of new API features and improvements for pedestrian and vehicle behaviour and the traffic manager to better mimic real world behaviour of cars and people.

The CARLA garage now has a new vehicle, the Volkswagen T2 2021. All generation 1 and 2 cars now include opening doors that can interact with the environment through collisions, especially useful for training and testing autonomous vehicles in car parks or on tight city streets. 

The traffic manager now offers __new API functionality__ to guide vehicles with a __user defined path__, defined by location waypoints or through route commands like left, right, straight, etc.

__Installation improvements:__ the CARLA agents wheel is now __available through PyPi__ so can now be installed with pip. A new wheel for the CARLA library is now also available for Python version 3.9.

The user can also now define custom animations and gestures for pedestrians through the python API. 
 

- [__Traffic Manager__](#traffic-manager): New functions for user defined paths


## Traffic Manager

The traffic manager has been given some great new functionality to extend user control over the behaviour of vehicles in the traffic manager. The API now exposes new traffic manager functions that can be used to guide vehicles with a user-defined custom path.

The set_path function allows a custom route to be defined using coordinates defined as CARLA Locations:

```py
path = [carla.Location(x=-506.696198, y=179.384308, z=0.038194),
                    carla.Location(x=-504.745972, y=232.868927, z=0.039417)]
traffic_manager.set_path(a, path)
```
The set_route function allows a custom route to be defined using route commands:

```py
route = ["Right", "Straight", "Right", "Right", "Left", "Right"]
 traffic_manager.set_route(a, route)
```
