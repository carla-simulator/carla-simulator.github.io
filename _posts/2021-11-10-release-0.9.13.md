The __0.9.13 release of CARLA__ is finally here, so read on to see how the new improvements will revolutionize your workflow. 

The most exciting new feature is the [__instance semantic segmentation__](#instance-semantic-segmentation)! A new camera sensor can be used to output images with the semantic tag and a unique ID for each world object embedded in the channels of the image file. Now the ground truth ID is available to differentiate objects of the same type in the camera field of view for training and evaluating networks to differentiate  and track overlapping objects of the same class. 

[__Runtime texture streaming__](#runtime-texture-streaming) is now possible through the CARLA API. This new functionality enables the rendering material of objects in the scene to be updated at runtime without requiring the Unreal Editor. This can help produce training data to avoid overfitting pitfalls.

CARLA's Python API now provides new functions to retrieve [__pedestrian bone positions__](#pedestrian-ground-truth-skeletons) and hence evaluate the pose, facilitating the evaluation and training of pose estimation models for use in autonomous driving and also adding custom gestures to standard animations through the API. 

CARLA 0.9.13 presents new assets to add to your simulations. [__4 new pedestrians__](#new-pedestrians) are provided including 2 children! The CARLA garage now has a [__brand new vehicle__](#new-volkswagen-van), the [__Volkswagen T2 2021__](#new-volkswagen-van). All generation 2 cars now include [__opening doors__](#opening-doors) that can interact with the environment through collisions. Especially useful for training and testing autonomous vehicles in car parks or on tight city streets. 

This release comes with major improvements to the traffic manager, with new logic to promote [__more realistic vehicle behavior at intersections and at high speeds__](#improved-traffic-manager-logic). The API now offers new functionality to guide vehicles with a __user defined route or path__ and __vehicle lights__ now react to weather conditions and junctions. 

__installation improvements:__ following a continued commitment to improve the useability of the CARLA simulator, the CARLA agents wheel is now __available through PyPi__ so can now be installed with pip. A new wheel for the core CARLA API library is now also available for Python version 3.9.


## Instance Semantic Segmentation

CARLA now has a brand new instance semantic segmentation sensor that outputs images containing a different ID for every object of the same type. Instance semantic IDs are now available embedded in the G and B channels of the RGB output of the sensor data, alongside the standard semantic IDs in the R channel. The new functionality provides access to the ground truth identity of objects traversing the sensor field of view, enabling training, improvement and evaluation of instance semantic segmentation networks. This new functionality brings a whole new world of possibilities for training machine learning algorithms to differentiate overlapping objects in scenes.

## Runtime texture streaming

The API now exposes functionality to update textures during runtime to allow texture modification without relying on the UE4 editor. Textures can now be updated and modified programmatically through the API, allowing texture updating to occur for example during the execution of a neural network training script. This can be useful for example when training neural networks to avoid overfitting pitfalls, tuning networks to focus more on shape and form rather than color or texture. 

```py
texture = carla.TextureColor(width,height)
for x in range(0,len(image[0])):
    for y in range(0,len(image)):
        color = image[y][x]
        r = int(color[0])
        g = int(color[1])
        b = int(color[2])
        a = int(color[3])
        texture.set(x, height - y - 1, carla.Color(r,g,b,a))
world.apply_color_texture_to_object('SM_Cartel_Add_5', carla.MaterialParameter.Diffuse, texture, 0)
```

## Pedestrian ground truth skeletons

The CARLA API now provides functionality to retrieve the ground truth bone positions of pedestrians in the simulation. This opens up a wealth of possibilities for training and evaluation of human pose estimation models for use in autonomous driving. A CARLA vehicle can now record the bone positions of nearby pedestrians to compliment it's sensor data with access to the ground truth pose for comparison with model-estimated poses. This new functionality also allows easy augmentation of pedestrian behavior with custom guestures blended into the default animations like waving or pointing. 

The following animation shows a custom animation handled by the Python API retrieving the bones then blending between the neutral pose and a custom walking animation handled through the API:

![pedestrian_animation](/img/posts/2021-11-07/pedestrian.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

The following code gets a pedestrian's bones controlling the arms and adjusts the arms' pose:

```py
# get the bones
bones = actor.get_bones()

# modify some bones
new_pose = []
for bone in bones.bone_transforms:
    if bone.name == "crl_foreArm__L":
        bone.relative.rotation.pitch -= 90
        new_pose.append((bone.name, bone.relative))
    elif bone.name == "crl_foreArm__R":
        bone.relative.rotation.pitch -= 90
        new_pose.append((bone.name, bone.relative))

# set the new pose
control = carla.WalkerBoneControlIn()
control.bone_transforms = new_pose
actor.set_bones(control)

# blend the pose
actor.blend_pose(0.5)
```

## New CARLA assets

### New pedestrians

4 new pedestrians have been added to the CARLA assets. 2 adults (each with 3 variants) and 2 children.

### New volkswagen van

The CARLA garage has built an exciting new vehicle, the __Volkswagen T2 2021__. Add some charm to your city traffic with this beautifully retro styled vehicle.

### Opening Doors

All generation 2 vehicles now have articulated doors that can be opened and closed through functions in the python API. This functionality is ideal for simulating scenarios in busy city streets and car parks where doors may open unpredictably while driving past or might be blocking access to parking spaces or passageways.

## Improved traffic manager logic

The traffic manager has undergone a major update with updated logic for handling vehicle behavior. Traffic now behaves in a more realistic manner at intersections. Vehicle turning is now improved to adapt much better at high speeds. Collision detection at high speeds is enhanced to garner more realistic rapid traffic behavior. 

### User defined paths in traffic manager

The traffic manager has been extended with some great new functionality to extend user control over the behavior of vehicles in the traffic manager. The API now exposes new traffic manager functions that can be used to guide vehicles with a user-defined custom path.

The traffic manager now exposes the `get_next_action` function to access the next action that a traffic manager guided vehicle will take and the `get_all_actions` enables the user to query all possible actions a traffic manager guided vehicle has available.

The `set_path` function allows a custom route to be defined using coordinates defined as CARLA Locations:

```py
path = [carla.Location(x=-506.696198, y=179.384308, z=0.038194),
                    carla.Location(x=-504.745972, y=232.868927, z=0.039417)]
traffic_manager.set_path(vehicle, path)
```
The `set_route` function allows a custom route to be defined using route commands:

```py
route = ["Right", "Straight", "Right", "Right", "Left", "Right"]
 traffic_manager.set_route(vehicle, route)
```

![set_route](/img/posts/2021-11-07/follow_route.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

### Traffic manager controlled vehicle lights

The traffic manager now has functionality to control vehicle lights. Headlights, fog lights and indicators are controlled according to vehicle route data and weather conditions. Indicator lights will activate according to the next planned turn in the route, braking lights will activate when the vehicle brakes are applied and fog lights and main beams are activated according to the weather and light conditions. During night, the vehicle main beams are activated and in foggy conditions the rear fog lights are activated. 



### Improved vehicle behavior - gears and braking

Vehicle physics has been improved with updated acceleration, braking and gear behaviors. The acceleration and braking behavior of the vehicles has been carefully remodelled to more accurately capture the behavior of the CARLA garage vehiclesâ€™ real world counterparts, with much care taken to reproduce published braking distance behavior as accurately as possible. Similarly the gear change behavior has been altered to better model real world behavior gear changes.

## Python library upgrades

Continuing to improve the useability of the CARLA Python API, the CARLA agents package that allows custom control of NPC vehicles within the simulation is now distributed through PyPi. Up until now the CARLA agents package has been delivered as an egg file in the CARLA core package, requiring environment variable adjustments to function .`carla-agents` is now available as a python wheel through PyPi, allowing a convenient installation through the native python package manager PIP.

![pip_install](/img/posts/2021-11-07/pip_install_carla_agents.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}


New wheels are now available for Python version 3.9 for both Linux and Windows.
