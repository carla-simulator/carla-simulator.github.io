We are excited to announce the new features included in the **CARLA 0.9.7** release!

{% include youtube.html id="9aFK-enG5dQ" %}

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.9.7" %}

This release brings the long-awaited traffic manager. We have also worked on improving our sensor suite, adding a new IMU sensor and our first RADAR implementation. Furthermore, the camera model has been extended to give control over additional parameters, such as lens distortion, exposure time, and many others. You will also find a new customizable pedestrian navigation module, and illumination improvements, among many other features and fixes.

Let's take a detailed look at the new features!

## A flexible-and-efficient Traffic Manager!
---


The Autopilot has been recently replaced by the first version of the Traffic Manager !! This new module is built on client side, leveraging the C++ CARLA API, with the objective of providing a more configurable way of controlling traffic, while reducing the overhead of the server. The main objevtive of the Traffic Manager is to improve the way cars roam around the city, whilst giving users the option to **customize traffic** like never before. To achieve this, we have built an architecture that allows users to pass information through several stages and manage shared data structures.


![Traffic_Manager](/img/posts/2019-12-11/Traffic_Manager.gif){:class="img-fluid"} 


The Traffic Manager allows users to interact with
a list of parameters:

* Distance to leading vehicle
* Allow speed above limit
* Percentage of velocity reduction from the speed limit
* Percentage to respect “keep right” rule
* Percentage of running a traffic light
* Ignore pedestrians
* Ignore other vehicles
* Force a lane change
* Turn lane changes on/off.
* Percentage of overtaking, when possible
* Percentage to avoid tailgating, when possible.


## Extended sensor suite!!  
---


### **RADAR**

Description
A new RADAR sensor has been added to CARLA. This first implementation brings a low-fidelity RADAR sensor with the goal of having a suitable placeholder to complete the sensor suite. The new RADAR uses raycasting to obtain returns from objects and estimates range, azimuth, altitude and velocity. The two main classes to control the RADAR are `RadarMeasurement` and `RadarDetection`. Please, check the [API](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/)! document
 and the example below for further information.


**Code example**

```py
...
# Get radar blueprint
radar_bp = bp_lb.filter('sensor.other.radar')[0]

# Set Radar attributes, by default are:
radar_bp.set_attribute('horizontal_fov', '30') # degrees

radar_bp.set_attribute('vertical_fov', '30') # degrees

radar_bp.set_attribute('points_per_second', '1500')
radar_bp.set_attribute('range', '100') # meters


# Spawn the radar
radar = world.spawn_actor(radar_bp, carla.Transform())

# Create a radar's callback that just prints the data
def radar_callback(weak_radar, sensor_data):
    self = weak_radar()
    if not self:
        return
    for detection in sensor_data:
        print('depth:    ' + str(detection.depth)) # meters

        print('azimuth:  ' + str(detection.azimuth)) # rad

        print('altitude: ' + str(detection.altitude)) # rad

        print('velocity: ' + str(detection.velocity)) # m/s


weak_radar = weakref.ref(radar)
# Bind the callback
radar.listen(lambda sensor_data: radar_callback(weak_radar, sensor_data))

```

**Visualization example**

We have created some examples to visualize the RADAR data. In those examples rhe red intensity means negative speed, and the blue one refers to positive speed in sensor coordinates. range (meters), azimuth (radians), and elevation (radians) are used to calculate the 3d position of each detection.

>Radar speed information with the RGB camera

The example shows a vehicle approaching from the right side of an static RADAR.

### **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**

Added support for real-time IMU and Radar data visualization in `manual_control.py`.

New IMU sensor that provides:

* Accelerometer (m/s<sup>2</sup>)
* Gyroscope (rad/s)
* Compass (rad)

Added new noise atributions:
```py
sensor.other.imu
    Attributes:
        noise_accel_stddev_x (Float)
        noise_accel_stddev_y (Float)
        noise_accel_stddev_z (Float)
        noise_gyro_bias_x (Float)
        noise_gyro_bias_y (Float)
        noise_gyro_bias_z (Float)
        noise_gyro_stddev_x (Float)
        noise_gyro_stddev_y (Float)
        noise_gyro_stddev_z (Float)
        noise_seed (Int)
```

## Exntended sensors

### **Extended camera sensor**

We have added more control over the RGB camera sensor, so you can create new configurations beyond the basic pinhole model.
All the currently available RGB camera settings can be modified as follows:

```py
# Sensor

camera_bp.set_attribute('sensor_tick', str(0.0))

# Image

camera_bp.set_attribute('image_size_x', str(800))
camera_bp.set_attribute('image_size_y', str(600))
camera_bp.set_attribute('gamma', str(2.2))

# Camera (used for manual exposure and depth of field)

camera_bp.set_attribute('fov', str(90.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('shutter_speed', str(60.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('iso', str(1200.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('fstop', str(1.4)) # Aperture is 1.0 / fstop

camera_bp.set_attribute('min_fstop', str(1.2)) # Maximum Aperture

camera_bp.set_attribute('blade_count', str(5))

# Exposure ("manual" by default)

camera_bp.set_attribute('exposure_mode', str('manual'))
camera_bp.set_attribute('exposure_compensation', str(3.0))

# Exposure - histogram specific (used when "exposure_mode" == "histogram")

camera_bp.set_attribute('exposure_min_bright', str(0.1))
camera_bp.set_attribute('exposure_max_bright', str(2.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('exposure_speed_up', str(3.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('exposure_speed_down', str(1.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('calibration_constant', str(16.0))

# Depth of field

camera_bp.set_attribute('focal_distance', str(1000.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('blur_amount', str(1.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('blur_radius', str(0.0))

# Motion Blur

camera_bp.set_attribute('motion_blur_intensity', str(0.45))
camera_bp.set_attribute('motion_blur_max_distortion', str(0.35))
camera_bp.set_attribute('motion_blur_min_object_screen_size', str(0.1))

# Tonemapper

camera_bp.set_attribute('slope', str(0.88))
camera_bp.set_attribute('toe', str(0.55))
camera_bp.set_attribute('shoulder', str(0.26))
camera_bp.set_attribute('black_clip', str(0.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('white_clip', str(0.04))

# Color

camera_bp.set_attribute('temp', str(6500.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('tint', str(0.0))

# Other

camera_bp.set_attribute('enable_postprocess_effects', str(True))
```
>_in this example they all are set to the default value_

More information about these attributes can be found in the UE4 official docs:

* [Automatic Exposure](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Rendering/PostProcessEffects/AutomaticExposure/index.html)!

* [Cinematic DOF Methods](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Rendering/PostProcessEffects/DepthOfField/CinematicDOFMethods/index.html)!

* [Color Grading](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Rendering/PostProcessEffects/ColorGrading/index.html)!

### **Lens distortion**

Now all the camera-based sensors (_RGB, Depht and Semantic Segmentation_) are provided with and additional lens distortion shader. You can see the effect of just increasing the `lens_circle_multiplier` value to `1.0` - `2.0`.

```py
camera_bp.set_attribute('lens_circle_falloff', str(5.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('lens_circle_multiplier', str(0.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('lens_k', str(-1.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('lens_kcube', str(0.0))
camera_bp.set_attribute('lens_x_size', str(0.08))
camera_bp.set_attribute('lens_y_size', str(0.08))
```
Also, exposed chromatic aberration for `sensor.camera.rgb`:

```py
rgb_camera_bp.set_attribute('chromatic_aberration_intensity', str(0.5)) # 0.0 by default

rgb_camera_bp.set_attribute('chromatic_aberration_offset', str(0.0))
```
Changed `manual_control.py` so you can visualize a lens distortion example pressing `8`.

### **GNSS**

Moved the GNSS sensor from client to server side.

**Advantages**
* Fewer calculations on the client-side.
* Exactly the same output for different clients listening to the same sensor.

**Limitations**
* More calculations on the server-side.
* More networking traffic.

Added new noise atributions:

```py
sensor.other.gnss
    Attributes:
        noise_alt_bias (Float)
        noise_alt_stddev (Float)
        noise_lat_bias (Float)
        noise_lat_stddev (Float)
        noise_lon_bias (Float)
        noise_lon_stddev (Float)
        noise_seed (Int)
```


## API changes
---


We had to make some changes in the API in order to implement new functions related to sensors. These are the new API changes:

* Lidar: `range` is now set in meters, not in centimeters
* Lidar: `horizontal_angle` is now received in radians, not in degrees
* GNSS: `carla.GnssEvent` renamed to `carla.GnssMeasurement`



## New Pedestrian Navigation module
---


With this new feature users can control and define the path that pedestrians will follow automatically, which can be controlled using the CARLA API! Now it is possible for pedestrians to automatically cross  enabled walkways (sidewalks and crosswalks) using a new AI system.

![Pedestrian_Crossing](/img/posts/2019-12-11/Pedestrian_Crossing.gif){:class="img-fluid"} 


It is possible to create your own enabled walkways for pedestrians with:
* Carla Exporter
* Binary Generator

Check it out in our [tutorial](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_generate_pedestrians_navigation)!

![Pedestrian_Navigation](/img/posts/2019-12-11/Pedestrian_Navigation.jpg){:class="img-fluid"} 
>Semantic segmentation for pedestrian navigation created with our plug-in _Carla Exporter_ and _Binary Generator_


Users can set a % of pedestrian who will cross randomly over the roads. They can also set the pedestrian speed between walking or running.

```py
# set how many pedestrians can cross the road (10%)

world.set_pedestrians_cross_factor(0.1)
```


```py
if walker_bp.has_attribute('speed'):
  if (random.random() > 0.5):
    # walking

    walker_speed = walker_bp.get_attribute('speed').recommended_values[1]
  else:
    # running

    walker_speed = walker_bp.get_attribute('speed').recommended_values[2]
```

The pedestrians are now aware if there is a car near by when they are going to cross a crosswalk and act accordingly.


## Improved Pedestrians
---

### **New pedestrian animations and controller**

We have improved the pedestrian animation controller. In addition to improving their animations we have added a new animation state. Latest changes in animation include animation clips from Mocap sources to increase realism. 

The basic controller included walk, run and idle state/animations. There is also a new state: pivot. This stae covers situations in which pedestrians are stationary, but reorienting themselves to face a different direction. 


![Pedestrian_Animations](/img/posts/2019-12-11/Pedestrian_Animations.gif){:class="img-fluid"} 

All these additions have been designed to improve in pedestrian's navigation, and to produce more natural behaviors. Nevertheless, the team will continue increasing the realism of pedestrian in future releases.


### **New pedestrian skin shader**

We have also made a few improvements to pedestrian's materials. New materials are created using SSS (SubSurface Scattering) shader for the skin. 

## New illumination system
---

With the new SSAO function, we achieved more natural shadows, boosting the Ambient Occlusion effect in real time.

## Matched cameras between unreal editor and client
---

In this last update, we have tweaked the camera’s values so that the CARLA client looks the same as the Unreal Engine editor and spectator windows.
