The CARLA team is delighted to announce that our Leaderboard partners, [__Guardstrike__](https://guardstrike.com/), have released the [__CARLA-Apollo bridge__](https://github.com/guardstrikelab/carla_apollo_bridge). 

[__Apollo__](https://github.com/guardstrikelab/apollo) is an open-source L4 autonomous driving software stack used by many OEMs, solution vendors, developers and researchers. The CARLA-Apollo bridge connects the two popular open-source software packages, enabling Apollo software stacks to drive the CARLA simulator and receive, assimilate, interpret and visualize data through the extensively featured Apollo interface.

This promises great new potential for both user communities, connecting a high performance, flexible platform for accelerating development and testing of AD software stacks with the industry's most widely used open-source simulator.
