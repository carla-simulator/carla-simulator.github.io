We at the CARLA organization are thrilled and inspired by the enthusiastic reception of the [CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge 2023!](https://leaderboard.carla.org/). This is an exciting opportunity for innovators to test their autonomous driving systems in new challenging situations. 

Here's what you need to know:

- **New Leaderboard 2.0 Platform**: Taking the challenge to a new level, the competition now includes new regions, new routes, and a more extensive set of traffic scenarios. Get the details on our official website: https://leaderboard.carla.org/

- **Submit to Leaderboard 2.0 Tracks**: We have developed new tools to ease the data acquisition process for the 2.0 routes. Time to step up the game and submit your solutions to these new tracks! More information on how to get started is available here: https://leaderboard.carla.org/get_started/.

- **Important Update**: Leaderboard 1.0 will **NOT** accept new submissions during the 2023 challenge.

- **Event Announcement**: The results of the CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge 2023 will be revealed in an independent online event in early December, hosted by the Embodied AI Foundation and CARLA's sponsors. As always, we will invite teams behind the top submissions to participate.

Please note that, unlike previous editions, **the results won't be presented at NeurIPS WS**. For a summary of these exciting changes, don't miss our [new video instructions](https://youtu.be/ChOY-IFtgaw). 

This year's challenge promises to be bigger and bolder than ever! Get involved, innovate, and help shape the future of autonomous driving. [Your adventure begins here!](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2098/overview).
