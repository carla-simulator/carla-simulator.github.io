The CARLA team is excited to announce the release of **CARLA version 0.10.0**. The biggest news is that this version delivers a with monumental leap forward through a **migration from Unreal Engine 4.26 to Unreal Engine 5.5**, introducing the incredible [Lumen](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-technical-details-in-unreal-engine) and [Nanite](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine) technologies into CARLA's core rendering engine, **enhancing realism, detail and performance**. This engine upgrade brings vasty **improved visual fidelity for camera sensors** through Unreal Engine 5's enhanced rendering technology.

With the new capabilities delivered by the engine upgrade, 0.10.0 delivers **brand new environments and assets** with a **revamped Town 10** and **beautifully remodelled vehicles** along with a spectacular off-road **open-cast mine map** generously provided by CARLA's sponsor and consortium member [**Synkrotron**](https://www.synkrotron.ai/). 

As if that wasn't enough, version 0.10.0 also brings state-of-the-art generative AI traffic simulation through a new integration with [Inverted AI](https://www.inverted.ai/home)

## Improved camera fidelity

Unreal Engine 5 significantly enhances CARLA's capability to render high detail geometry with **stunningly realistic lighting and reflections**. The new Nanite virtualized geometry system dynamically scales the number of polygons used to render assets, ensuring efficient performance when viewing the object from a distance while retaining incredible detail up close. This means CARLA maps and assets now have an almost **unlimited "geometry budget"**, permitting the use of **highly detailed 3D assets** without sacrificing performance. Lumen brings a new level of realism to simulating scene lighting and reflections by more accurately modeling complex light behavior such as diffuse interreflections and specular highlights. This results in scenes that look more natural that dynamically adapt to lighting changes in a realistic way. Altogether, Unreal Engine 5.5 enhances CARLA's overall visual fidelity with amazing results.

## Stunning new environments and assets

### Revamped Town 10

The enhanced geometry handling system underpinning CARLA opens the door to rendering environments with much higher polygon counts and more realistic lighting. To fully exploit this, this version of CARLA presents a revamped Town 10 with brand new buildings, pavements, roads and vegetation all organized around the same familiar Town 10 road network.

The newly remodeled town includes impressive new towerblocks with dazzling reflective glass, including meticulously detailed retail units on the lowest floors. The extra detail permitted by the new geometry system really shows in the magnificent classically styled buildings found in several places in the map.

Additionally, Town 10 introduces some new construction assets, adding the impression of an evolving cityscape.

**NEW ROAD TOPOLOGY**

### Remodeled vehicles

On top of Town 10's makeover, version 0.10.0 comes with a roster of 11 beautifully remodeled vehicles, exploiting the higher geometry budget available to capture every detail.

### New off-road mine map from Synkrotron

With release 0.10.0, CARLA goes off-road with a spectacular open-cast mine map, provided by CARLA consortium member and sponsor [**Synkrotron**](https://www.synkrotron.ai/).

Included with the mine map is an incredible giant mining earth mover to populate the map with vehicle traffic common in mining and heavy industry.

## Inverted AI traffic simulation

![invertedai_logo](/img/posts/2024-12-11/inverted_ai_logo.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Inverted AI provides state-of-the-art traffic simulation technology based on generative artificial intelligence trained using an extensive database of real world traffic data. Inverted AI's traffic simulation delivers reactive, realistic, human-like behavior for NPCs in your CARLA simulations, facilitating development of autonomous agents capable of safely navigating the unpredictable behavior of human road users. All delivered through a convenient web-based Python API, integration with CARLA is straightforward. An example script is provided to get you started using realistic and behaviorally diverse traffic.

## Documentation

The documentation for the Unreal Engine 5.5 version of CARLA is now hosted on a new URL to distinguish it clearly from the Unreal Engine 4.26 version of CARLA, which will continue to be actively developed. 

* The CARLA UE 5.5 documentation is hosted on its own URL here: [**carla-ue5.readthedocs.io**](https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* Documentation for CARLA UE 4.26 remains in the same place as always: [**carla.readthedocs.io**](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
