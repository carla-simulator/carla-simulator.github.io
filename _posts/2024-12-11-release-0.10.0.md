The CARLA team is excited to announce the release of **CARLA version 0.10.0**. The biggest news is that this version delivers a monumental leap forward in visual fidelity through a **migration from Unreal Engine 4.26 to Unreal Engine 5.5**. CARLA 0.10.0 introduces the incredible [Lumen](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lumen-technical-details-in-unreal-engine) and [Nanite](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine) technologies into CARLA's core rendering engine, **enhancing realism, detail and performance**. This engine upgrade brings **vastly improved visual fidelity for camera sensors** through Unreal Engine 5's enhanced rendering technology.

To exploit the new capabilities delivered by the engine upgrade, 0.10.0 comes with **upgraded environments and assets** with a **revamped Town 10** and **beautifully remodeled vehicles** along with a spectacular off-road **open-cast mine map** generously provided by CARLA's sponsor and consortium member [**Synkrotron**](https://www.synkrotron.ai/). 

As if that wasn't enough, version 0.10.0 also brings state-of-the-art generative AI traffic simulation through a new **integration with [Inverted AI](https://www.inverted.ai/home)**, **native ROS integration**, **updated Python compatibility** and more!

## Improved camera fidelity

Unreal Engine 5.5 significantly enhances CARLA's capability to render **highly detailed geometry** with **stunningly realistic lighting and reflections**. The new Nanite virtualized geometry system dynamically scales the number of polygons used to render assets, ensuring efficient performance when viewing objects from a distance while retaining incredible detail up close. This means CARLA maps and assets now have an almost **unlimited *geometry budget***, permitting the use of **highly detailed 3D assets** without sacrificing performance. Lumen brings a new level of realism to simulating scene lighting and reflections by more accurately modeling complex light behavior such as diffuse interreflections and specular highlights. This results more natural looking scenes that dynamically adapt to lighting changes in a realistic way. Altogether, Unreal Engine 5.5 enhances CARLA's overall visual fidelity with amazing results.

## Stunning new environments and assets

### Revamped Town 10

The enhanced geometry handling system underpinning CARLA opens the door to rendering environments with much higher polygon counts and more realistic lighting. To fully exploit this, this version of CARLA presents a revamped Town 10 with brand new buildings, pavements, roads and vegetation all organized around the same familiar road network.

The newly remodeled town includes impressive new towerblocks with dazzling reflective glass, including meticulously detailed retail units on the lowest floors. The extra detail permitted by the new geometry system really shows in the magnificent classically styled buildings found in several places in the map.

Additionally, Town 10 introduces some new construction assets, giving the impression of an evolving cityscape.

**Enhanced road topology**

The enhancements in detail in Town 10 extend right down to the road surface itself. Town 10's roads now have a realistic camber and sporadic road surface variations such as potholes and speed bumps which impact not only the appearance, but also vehicle dynamics and sensors, further enhancing simulation realism.

### Upgraded vehicle roster

On top of Town 10's makeover, version 0.10.0 comes with a roster of 11 beautifully remodeled vehicles, exploiting the higher geometry budget available and improved lighting to capture every detail with enhanced definition.

Unreal Engine 5 also introduces the new [Chaos physics engine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/chaos-physics-overview?application_version=4.27) with additional options for vehicle dynamics modeling. All vehicles included in CARLA 0.10.0 now use the new engine, adding more realistic modeling of suspension behavior.

### New off-road mine map from Synkrotron

With release 0.10.0, CARLA goes off-road with a spectacular open-cast mine map, provided by CARLA consortium member and sponsor [**Synkrotron**](https://www.synkrotron.ai/). The map includes a parking area connected to the mine area through a small network of access roads.

Included with the mine map is an incredible giant mining earth mover to populate the map with heavy industry traffic.

## Inverted AI traffic simulation

![invertedai_logo](/img/posts/2024-12-11/invertedai_logo.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

[Inverted AI](https://www.inverted.ai/home) provides state-of-the-art traffic simulation technology based on generative artificial intelligence trained using an extensive database of real world traffic data. Inverted AI's traffic simulation delivers reactive, realistic, human-like behavior for NPCs into your CARLA simulations, facilitating development of autonomous agents capable of safely navigating the unpredictable behavior of human road users. All delivered through a convenient web-based Python API, integration with CARLA is straightforward. An example script is provided to get you started using realistic and behaviorally diverse traffic.

# ROS2 native interface

![ros_carla](/img/posts/2024-12-11/ros_carla.webp){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Release 0.10.0 officially introduces CARLA's new native ROS2 interface. This means that ROS connectivity is built right into CARLA's server, negating the need for an intermediate bridge process, resulting in lower latencies and simplified AD stack setup. You can enable ROS2 connectivity right out of the box with the new command line flag: 

```sh
./CarlaUnreal.sh --ros2
```

## SCENIC 3 integration

CARLA 0.10.0 now fully supports SCENIC version 3. CARLA users can exploit the SCENIC 3 scenario definition language to define and execute scenarios in CARLA 0.10.0. 

# Updated Python compatibility

The latest version of CARLA now brings improved compatibility with support for newer versions of Python. CARLA 0.10.0 provides support for the following Python versions in both Ubuntu and Windows:

* 3.8
* 3.9
* 3.10
* 3.11
* 3.12

*Support for versions 3.7 and lower is dropped from this release.**

## Documentation

The documentation for the Unreal Engine 5.5 version of CARLA is now hosted on a new URL to distinguish it clearly from the Unreal Engine 4.26 version of CARLA, which will continue to be actively developed. 

* The CARLA UE 5.5 documentation is hosted on its own URL here: [**carla-ue5.readthedocs.io**](https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* Documentation for CARLA UE 4.26 remains in the same place as always: [**carla.readthedocs.io**](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Differences between CARLA 0.9.15 and 0.10.0

While CARLA version 0.10.0 boasts incredible new functionality, the engine upgrade from Unreal Engine version 4.26 to version 5.5 entails a significant change to the simulator's core. While the CARLA team has worked hard to transfer as much functionality as possible from previous versions to the new version, it is a work in progress and some functionality and content is yet to be updated. The following is an overview of functionality that is missing or untested in version 0.10.0:

* Weather is fixed to daylight setting. Clouds, rain, fog and sun position cannot be modified
