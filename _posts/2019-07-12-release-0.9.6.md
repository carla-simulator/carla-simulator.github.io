We are proud to announce the new features included in **CARLA 0.9.6**!

{% include youtube.html id="TOojcifcRBA" %}

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.9.6" %}

This release brings back long-requested features, such as automatic pedestrian navigation (AI-controlled), better visual
quality and a new skeleton control API, among other improvements.

Let's take a detailed look at what is new!

## Behold the new pedestrian AI!

With this new feature users can control and define the path that pedestrians will follow automatically, which can be
controlled using CARLA API!

There are a few types of pedestrians, male, female, both in kid and adult forms. Also, they can spawn at random points
over sidewalks and walk over them.

_Currently, it is not possible for pedestrians to automatically cross the road using the AI system, but it will be soon!_

![pedestrian_ai](/img/posts/2019-07-12/pedestrians.gif){:class="img-fluid"}

A new controller class has been created to manage the pedestrians (walkers) automatically.

```
carla.WalkerAIController:
  start()
  stop()
  go_to_location(destination)
  set_max_speed(speed)
```

To control a walker, it is just needed to spawn a `controller.ai.walker` and attach it to a walker actor, then
initialize the controller and set its parameters.

```py
blueprintsWalkers = random.choice(world.get_blueprint_library().filter("walker.*"))
walker_controller_bp = world.get_blueprint_library().find('controller.ai.walker')

walker_actor = world.spawn_actor(walker_bp, spawn_point)
walker_controller_actor = world.spawn_actor(walker_controller_bp, carla.Transform(), walker_actor)

world.wait_for_tick()

walker_controller_actor.start()
walker_controller_actor.go_to_location(world.get_random_location_from_navigation())
walker_controller_actor.set_max_speed(1.4)

#...
```

> Code example 1. Spawning a pedestrian and setting its destination.

Once the simulation has started, pedestrians will walk to their destination and come back to the origin point continually.

You can test it out with the updated script **spawn_npc.py** which has the option to spawn pedestrians with the flag `-w`.

```py
> python spawn_npc.py -w 20
```

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api_tutorial/#pedestrians)!

## Improved Pedestrians

In CARLA we are growing our family!

New pedestrians are joining our library of assets.
In addition to improving the looks of our previous citizens we are working on our future generations, boys and girls
will populate our streets.

![new_kids](/img/posts/2019-07-12/kids_photo.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 2. New kids.

Last, we are working on pedestrian variations, we've planned different haircuts and clothing for each. Also, each piece
of cloth will have different patterns and fabrics, new fashion trends and lots of styles.

> Figure 4. Pedestrian cloth variations.

## New skeleton control interface

Now all pedestrian actors have the same standard skeleton hierarchy, the same animation clips will behave similarly
and fit them all.

![pedestrian_skeleton](/img/posts/2019-07-12/pedestrian_skeleton.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 5. Pedestrian skeleton dance.

We have extended the API to allow users to take control of all the parts of a walker skeleton.

> Skeleton hierarchy.

A walker's skeleton can be modified by using an instance of the `WalkerBoneControl` class. This class contains the
transforms of the bones to be modified (as a tuple).

```py
control = carla.WalkerBoneControl()
first_tuple = ('crl_hand__R', carla.Transform(rotation=carla.Rotation(roll=90)))
second_tuple = ('crl_hand__L', carla.Transform(rotation=carla.Rotation(roll=90)))
control.bone_transforms = [first_tuple, second_tuple]
```

Changes to a walker can be applied as:

```py
walker_actor.apply_control(control)
```

The location and rotation of each transform are relative to their parent. Therefore when a parent bone's transform
is modified, the transforms of the child bones in model space will also be changed accordingly. Check it out in our
[documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walker_bone_control/)!

## Snapshots!

Now it is possible to know the state of every actor in the world at a certain frame. No need for synchronous mode
to be active!

The world snapshot contains a timestamp and a list of actor snapshots.

```
carla.WorldSnapshot:
  id
  frame
  timestamp

  has_actor(actor_id)
  find(actor_id)
```

```py
# Retrieve a snapshot of the world at this point in time.

world_snapshot = world.get_snapshot()

# Wait for the next tick and retrieve the snapshot of the tick.

world_snapshot = world.wait_for_tick()

# Register a callback to get called every time we receive a new snapshot.

world.on_tick(lambda world_snapshot: do_something(world_snapshot))

```
> Code example 2. Retrieving a world snapshot.

Actor snapshots contain the data about the physical state of the actor, and it is possible to retrieve the
actual actor through its id.

```
carla.ActorSnapshot:
  id

  get_transform()
  get_velocity()
  get_angular_velocity()
  get_acceleration()
```

In order to get an actor snapshot:

```py
> actor_snapshot = world_snapshot.find(actual_actor.id)
```

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api_tutorial/#world-snapshot)!

## Updated Synchronous mode

We have made a few modifications to the synchronous mode.

Now `tick` and `apply_settings` synchronize automatically with the server so there is no need that users manually
wait for tick. <b>Therefore the old recipe using `wait_for_tick` is no longer working on synchronous mode.</b>
<b style="color:red;">Old user scripts using that recipe will be affected!</b>

For more information and examples go to our
[documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring_the_simulation/#synchronous-mode)!

## Importing and exporting assets has never been easier!

With this new simplified pipeline it's easier to import and export **maps** & **props** and defining them in the
CARLA Blueprint Library.

Assets will be imported as independent packages that can be plugged and exported at any time inside CARLA.

### Importing

It is needed to place the files as in the following structure.

```
Import
|
├── Folder01
|   ├── MapToImport01
│   │   ├── Asphalt1_Diff.png
│   │   ├── Asphalt1_Norm.png
│   │   ├── Asphalt1_Spec.png
│   │   ├── Grass1_Diff.png
│   │   ├── Grass1_Norm.png
│   │   ├── Grass1_Spec.png
│   │   ├── LaneMarking1_Diff.png
│   │   ├── LaneMarking1_Norm.png
│   │   ├── LaneMarking1_Spec.png
│   │   ├── MapToImport01.fbx
│   │   └── MapToImport01.xodr
|   ├── MapToImport02
│   │   ├── MapToImport02.fbx
│   │   └── MapToImport02.xodr
|   ├── AssetsToImport
|   │   ├── PropToImport01
│   │   │   ├── PropToImport01_Diff.png
│   │   │   ├── PropToImport01_Norm.png
│   │   │   ├── PropToImport01_Spec.png
│   │   │   └── PropToImport01.fbx
│   │   ├── PropToImport02
│   │   │   └── PropToImport02.fbx
|   │   └── PropToImport03
│   │       └── PropToImport03.fbx
|   └── Package1.json
└── Folder02
    ├── AssetsToImport
    |   └── PropToImport04
    |       └── PropToImport04.fbx
    └── Package2.json
```

> Project structure.

Finally, a JSON file needs to be created for each package, as shown below.

```json
{
  "maps": [{
      "name": "MyTown01",
      "source": "./MapToImport01/MapToImport01.fbx",
      "use_carla_materials": true,
      "xodr": "./MapToImport01/MapToImport01.xodr"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyTown02",
      "source": "./MapToImport02/MapToImport02.fbx",
      "use_carla_materials": false,
      "xodr": "./MapToImport02/MapToImport02.xodr"
    }
  ],
  "props": [{
      "name": "MyProp01",
      "size": "medium",
      "source": "./AssetsToImport/PropToImport01/PropToImport01.fbx",
      "tag": "SemanticSegmentationTag01"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyProp02",
      "size": "small",
      "source": "./AssetsToImport/PropToImport02/PropToImport02.fbx",
      "tag": "SemanticSegmentationTag02"
    }
  ]
}
```

The next command will read the JSON file and take each asset and place it inside the Content in Unreal Engine.
It also creates a `Package1.Package.json` file inside used for **defining** its props in the blueprint library,
**exposing** them in the `Python API` and also **exporting** those assets if needed.

```sh
> make import
```

### Exporting

The following command will create the distribution packages compressed in a `.tar.gz` file for each cooked package
and place it in _Carla/dist/_ folder.

```sh
> make package ARGS="--packages=Package1,Package2"
```

Finally, you could use these distribution packages in the CARLA distribution by simply moving them to the CARLA
`Import` folder and executing the `ImportAssets.sh` script.

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asset_packages_for_dist/)!

## CARLA docker build

We've added a new way to compile CARLA: In a docker!

<b>We use _ue4-docker_ to use Unreal Engine inside Docker, that's why images produced by the python package
that contain UE4 Engine Tools, are prohibited from public distribution.</b> The tutorial can be found in our
[documentation](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/Util/Docker)!

## New python API reference

Finally, we have added a new section to our documentation. It is indeed the new python API reference, a compendium
of all the client-side API methods.

![python_api_reference](/img/posts/2019-07-12/python_API.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/)!

## Vulkan support

It is possible to run CARLA with Vulkan **(experimental)** or OpenGL. Vulkan performs faster than OpenGL but, as it is an experimental build,
there may be some graphical or memory consuming bugs that may affect the user experience when working with CARLA.

Vulkan will prevent CARLA to run off-screen and in Docker, so to run them it is needed to use OpenGL. Therefore the `-opengl` flag must be activated.

**Disclaimer:** Despite being an experimental build, Vulkan is the preferred API to run CARLA simulator.

Don't forget that there are two graphic quality levels, `Epic` and `Low`.

More information about Vulkan and OpenGL in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring_the_simulation/#graphics-quality)!
