Closing the summer on a high note, the long-awaited  __CARLA 0.9.10__ is here! Get comfortable. This is going to be an exciting trip.  

CARLA 0.9.10 comes with the trunk packed of improvements, with notable dedication to sensors. The LIDAR sensor been upgraded, and a brand-new semantic LIDAR sensor is here to provide with much more information of the surroundings. We are working to improve the rendering pipeline for cameras and, on the meantime, some changes in the sky atmosphere and RGB cameras have been made for those renders to look even better.  

This idea of renovation extends to other CARLA modules too. The architecture of Traffic Manager has been thoroughly revisited to improve the performance, and ensure consistency. It is now deserving of the name __TM 2.0__. The integration with Autoware has been improved and eased, facilitating an agent that can be used out-of-the-box. These improvements come along with the first integration of CARLA-ROS bridge with __ROS2__, to keep up with the new generation of ROS. Finally, the pedestrian gallery is going under renovation too. We want to provide with a more varied and realistic set of walkers that make the simulation feel alive.  

There are also some worth-mentioning additions. The integration with __OpenStreetMap__ (still experimental), allows users to generate CARLA maps based on the road definitions in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), an open-license world map. A plug-in repository has been created for contributors to share their work, and it already comes with a remarkable contribution. The __carlaviz__ plug-in allows for web browser visualization of the simulation. It has been developed and maintained by [mjxu96](https://github.com/mjxu96). We would like to take some extra time to thank all the external contributors that were part of this release. We are grateful for their work, and all their names will figure both in this post, and the release video.  

Last, but not least, we would also like to announce that... __the CARLA AD Leaderboard is finally open to the public!__ Test the driving proficiency of your AD agent, and share the results with the rest of the world. The announcement video can be found by the end of this post. Find out more in the [CARLA AD Leaderboard website](https://leaderboard.carla.org/)!

## LIDAR sensor upgrade
---

First and foremost, the performance of the LIDAR sensor has been greatly improved. This has been achieved while also providing with new colliders for the elements in the scene. The sensor representation of the world is now more detailed, and the elements in it are described much more accurately.  

![lidar_sensor](/img/posts/2020-31-07/lidar_old.gif){:class="img-fluid"}


Some new attributes have been added to the LIDAR parameterization. These make the sensor and the point cloud behave in a more realistic manner.  

*   __Intensity__ — The `raw_data` retrieved by the LIDAR sensor is now a 4D array of points. The fourth dimension contains an approximation of the intensity of the received ray. The intensity is reduced over time as the ray travels according to the formula:  

```sh
intensity / original_intensity = e * (-attenuation_coef * distance)
```  
The coefficient of attenuation may depend on the sensor's wavelenght and the conditions of the atmosphere. It can be modified with the LIDAR attribute: `atmosphere_attenuation_rate`.  
*   __Drop-off__ — In real sensors, some cloud points can be loss due to multiple reasons like perturbations on the atmosphere or sensor errors. We simulate these with two different models.  
	*   __General drop-off__ — Proportion of points that we drop-off randomly. This is done before the tracing, meaning the points being dropped are not calculated, and therefore performance is increased. If `dropoff_general_rate = 0.5`, half of the points will be dropped.
	*   __Instensity-based drop-off__ — For each point detected, and extra drop-off is calculated with a probability based in the computed intensity. This probability is determined by two parameters. `dropoff_zero_intensity` is the probability of points with zero intensity to be dropped. `dropoff_intensity_limit` is a threshold intensity above which no points will be dropped. The probability of a point within the range to be dropped is a linear proportion based on these two parameters.  
*   __Noise__ — The `noise_stddev` attribute makes for a noise model to simulate unexpected deviations that appear in real-life sensors. If the noise is positive, the location of each point will be randomly perturbed along the vector of the ray detecting it.



## Semantic LIDAR sensor
---

This sensor simulates a rotating LIDAR implemented using ray-casting that exposes all the information about the raycast hit. Its behaviour is quite similar to the LIDAR sensor, but there are two main differences between them.

*   The raw data retrieved by the semantic LIDAR includes more data per point.
	*   Coordinates of the point (as the normal LIDAR does).
	*   The cosine between the angle of incidence and the normal of the surface hit.
	*   Instance and semantic ground-truth. Basically the index of the CARLA object hit, and its semantic tag.
*   The semantic LIDAR does not include neither intensity, drop-off nor noise model attributes.

The capabilities of this sensor are remarkable. A simple visualization of the the Semantic LIDAR data provides with a much clear view of the surroundings.

## Extended semantic segmentation
---

The semantic ground-truth has been extended to recognize a wider range of categories. Now, the data retrieved by semantic segmentation sensors will be more precise, as many elements in the scene that were previously undetected, can be easily distinguished.  

![sem_seg_comparison](/img/posts/2020-31-07/sem_seg_comparison.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}

Here is a list of the categories currently available. Previously existing ones are marked in grey.  

*   __Bridge__ — Only the structure of the bridge. Fences, people, vehicles, an other elements on top of it are labeled separately.  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Building</b> — Buildings like houses, skyscrapers,... and the elements attached to them. <i> E.g. air conditioners, scaffolding, awning or ladders and much more.</i></span>  
*   __Dynamic__ — Other elements whose position is susceptible to change over time. <i> E.g. Movable trash bins, buggies, bags, wheelchairs, animals, etc.</i>  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Fence</b> — Barriers, railing, or other upright structures. Basically wood or wire assemblies that enclose an area of ground.  
*   __Ground__ — Any horizontal ground-level structures that does not match any other category. For example areas shared by vehicles and pedestrians, or flat roundabouts delimited from the road by a curb.  
*   __GuardRail__ — All types of guard rails/crash barriers.  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Other</b> — Everything that does not belong to any other category.</span>  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Pedestrian</b> — Humans that walk or ride/drive any kind of vehicle or mobility system. <i> E.g. bicycles or scooters, skateboards, horses, roller-blades, wheel-chairs, etc.</i></span>
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Pole</b> — Small mainly vertically oriented pole. If the pole has a horizontal part (often for traffic light poles) this is also considered pole. <i> E.g. sign pole, traffic light poles.</i></span>  
*   __RailTrack__ — All kind of rail tracks that are non-drivable by cars. <i> E.g. subway and train rail tracks.</i>  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Road</b> — Part of ground on which cars usually drive. <i> E.g. lanes in any directions, and streets.</i></span>
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>RoadLine</b> — The markings on the road.</span>  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Sidewalk</b> — Part of ground designated for pedestrians or cyclists. Delimited from the road by some obstacle (such as curbs or poles), not only by markings. This label includes a possibly delimiting curb, traffic islands (the walkable part), and pedestrian zones.</span>  
*   __Sky__ — Open sky. Includes clouds and the sun.  
*   __Static__ — Elements in the scene and props that are immovable. <i> E.g. fire hydrants, fixed benches, fountains, bus stops, etc.</i>  
*   __Terrain__ — Grass, ground-level vegetation, soil or sand. These areas are not meant to be driven on. This label includes a possibly delimiting curb.  
*   __TrafficLight__ — Traffic light boxes without their poles.  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>TrafficSign</b> — Signs installed by the state/city authority, usually for traffic regulation. This category does not include the poles where signs are attached to. <i> E.g. traffic- signs, parking signs, direction signs...</i></span>  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Unlabeled</b> — Elements that have not been categorized are considered <code>Unlabeled</code>. This category is meant to be empty or at least contain elements with no collisions.</span>  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Vegetation</b> — Trees, hedges, all kinds of vertical vegetation. Ground-level vegetation is considered <code>Terrain</code>.</span>  
*   __Vehicles__ — Cars, vans, trucks, motorcycles, bikes, buses, trains...  
*   <span style="color:grey"><b>Wall</b> — Individual standing walls. Not part of a building.</span>  
*   __Water__ — Horizontal water surfaces. <i> E.g. Lakes, sea, rivers.</i>  

## OpenStreetMap integration
---

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <small><i><strong>Warning!</strong> This feature is still in experimental phase.</i></small>
</div>

OpenStreetMap is an open license map of the world developed by contributors. Sections of these map can be exported to an XML file in `.osm` format. CARLA can convert this file to OpenDRIVE format, and ingest it as any other OpenDRIVE map using the [OpenDRIVE Standalone Mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_opendrive/). The process is detailed in the [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_G_openstreetmap/), but here is a summary.  

__1. Obtain a map with OpenStreetMap__ — Go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), and export the XML file containing the map information.  

__2. Convert to OpenDRIVE format__ — To do the conversion from `.osm` to `.xodr` format, two classes have been added to the Python API.  

*   __[carla.Osm2Odr](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaosm2odr)__ – The class that does the conversion. It takes the content of the `.osm` parsed as string, and returns a string containing the resulting `.xodr`.  
	*   `osm_file` — The content of the initial `.osm` file parsed as string.  
	*   `settings` — A [carla.Osm2OdrSettings](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaosm2odrsettings) object containing the settings for the conversion.  
*   __[carla.Osm2OdrSettings](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaosm2odrsettings)__ – Helper class that contains different parameters used during the conversion.  
	*   `use_offsets` *(default False)* — Determines whereas the map should be generated with an offset, thus moving the origin from the center according to that offset.  
	*   `offset_x` *(default 0.0)* — Offset in the X axis.  
	*   `offset_y` *(default 0.0)* — Offset in the Y axis.  
	*   `default_lane_width` *(default 4.0)* — Determines the width that lanes should have in the resulting XODR file.  
	*   `elevation_layer_height` *(default 0.0)* — Determines the height separating elements in different layers, used for overlapping elements. [Read more on layers](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer) for a better understanding of this.  


__3. Import into CARLA__ – The OpenDRIVE file can be automatically ingested in CARLA using the [OpenDRIVE Standalone Mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_opendrive/). Use either a customized script or the `config.py` example provided in CARLA.  

Here is an example of the feature at work. The image on the left belongs to the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) page. The image on the right is a fragment of that map area ingested in CARLA.<br>

![osm_comparison](/img/posts/2020-31-07/osm_comparison.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <small><i><strong>Warning!</strong> The roads generated end abruptly in the borders of the map. This will cause the TM to crash when vehicles are not able to find the next waypoint. To avoid this, the <a href="https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlatrafficmanager">OSM mode</a> is set to <b>True</b> by default. This will show a warning, and destroy vehicles when necessary.</i></small>
</div>

## Global bounding box accessibility
---

Up until now in the Python API, only [carla.Vehicle](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlavehicle), [carla.Walker](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlawalker), and [carla.Junction](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlajunction) had access to a bounding box containing their corresponding geometry. Now, the [carla.World](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaworld) has access to the bounding boxes of all the elements in the scene. These are returned in an array of [carla.BoundingBox](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaboundingbox). The query can be filtered using the enum class [carla.CityObjectLabel](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlacityobjectlabel). Note that the enum values in [carla.CityObjectLabel](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlacityobjectlabel) are the same as the [semantic segmentation categories](#extended-semantic-segmentation).

```sh
# Create the arrays to store the bounding boxes
all_bbs = []
filtered_bbs = []

# Return the bounding boxes of all the elements in the scene
all_bbs = world.get_level_bbs()

# Return the bounding boxes of the buildings in the scene
filtered_bbs = world.get_level_bbs(carla.CityObjectLabel.Buildings)
```

![bounding_boxes](/img/posts/2020-31-07/bounding_boxes.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}

Moreover, a [carla.BoundingBox](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaboundingbox) object now includes not only the extent and location of the box, but also its rotation.  

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <small><i><strong>Warning!</strong> All bounding boxes accessed through <b>carla.World</b> are described in world space. On the contrary, the bounding box of a <b>carla.Vehicle</b>, <b>carla.Walker</b> or <b>carla.Junction</b>, stores its location and rotation relative to the object it is attached to.</i></small>
</div>


## Enhanced vehicle physics
---

We have worked on the vehicle physics so that their volumes are more accurate, and the core physics (such as center of mass, suspension, wheel's friction...) are more realistic. The result is more noticeable whenever a vehicle turns or collides with another object. The balance of the vehicle is much greater now. The response to commands and collisions is no longer over-the-top, but restrained in favor of realism.  

![vehicle_physics](/img/posts/2020-31-07/vehicle_physics.gif){:class="img-fluid"}

Moreover, there are some additions in [carla.Actor](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carlaactor) that widen the range of physics directly applicable to vehicles.

*   [__carla.Actor.add_force(self,force)__](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Actor.add_force) — Applies a force at the center of mass of the actor. This method should be used for forces that are applied over a certain period of time.  

*   [__carla.Actor.add_torque(self,torque)__](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Actor.add_torque) — Applies a torque at the center of mass of the actor. This method should be used for torques that are applied over a certain period of time.  

*   [__carla.Actor.enable_constant_velocity(self,velocity)__](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Actor.enable_constant_velocity) — Sets a vehicle's velocity vector (local space) to a constant value over time. The resulting velocity will be approximately the `velocity` being set, as with [__carla.Actor.set_target_velocity(self,velocity)__](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Actor.set_target_velocity).

*   [__carla.Actor.disable_constant_velocity(self,velocity)__](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Actor.disable_constant_velocity) — Disables any constant velocity previously set for a [carla.Vehicle](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Vehicle) actor.  


## Plug-in repository
---

A new repository has been created purposely for external contributions. This is meant to be a space for contributors to develop and maintain their plug-ins and add-ons for CARLA.  

Take the chance, and share your work in the [plug-in repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-plugins)! CARLA is grateful to all the [contributors](#contributors) who dedicate their time to help the project grow. This is the perfect space to make your hard work visible for everybody.  


## carlaviz plug-in
---

This plug-in was created by the contributor [mjxu96](https://github.com/mjxu96), and it already figures in the [carla plug-ins repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-plugins). It creates a web browser window with some basic representation of the scene. Actors are updated on-the-fly, sensor data can be retrieved, and additional text, lines and polylines can be drawn in the scene.  

There is detailed [carlaviz documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins_carlaviz/) already available, but here is a brief summary on how to run the plug-in, and the output it provides.  

__1. Download carlaviz.__  

```sh
# Pull only the image that matches the CARLA package being used
docker pull mjxu96/carlaviz:0.9.6
docker pull mjxu96/carlaviz:0.9.7
docker pull mjxu96/carlaviz:0.9.8
docker pull mjxu96/carlaviz:0.9.9

# Pull this image if working on a CARLA build from source
docker pull carlasim/carlaviz:latest
```

__2. Run CARLA.__  

__3. Run carlaviz.__ In another terminal run the following command. Change `<name_of_Docker_image>` for the name of the image previously downloaded.  
E.g. `carlasim/carlaviz:latest` or `mjxu96/carlaviz:0.9.9`.  

```sh
docker run -it --network="host" -e CARLAVIZ_HOST_IP=localhost -e CARLA_SERVER_IP=localhost -e CARLA_SERVER_PORT=2000 <name_of_Docker_image>
```
__4. Open the localhost__ carlaviz runs by default in port `8080`. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.  

The plug-in shows a visualization window on the right. The scene is updated in real-time. A sidebar on the left side contains a list of items to be shown. Some of these items will appear in the visualization window, others (mainly sensor and game data) appear just above the item list. The result will look similar to the following.  

![carlaviz](/img/posts/2020-31-07/carlaviz.gif){:class="img-fluid"}

## Traffic Manager 2
---

For this iteration, the inner structure and logic of the Traffic Manager module has been revamped. These changes are explained in detail in the [Traffic Manager documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_traffic_manager/). Here is a brief summary of the principles that set the ground for the new architecture.  

*   __Data query centralization.__ The most impactful component in the new Traffic Manager 2.0 logic is the ALSM. It takes care of all the server calls necessary to get the current state of the simulation, and stores everything that will be needed further on: lists of vehicles and walkers, their position and velocity, static attributes such as bounding boxes, etc. Everything is queried by the ALSM and cached so that computational cost is reduced, and redundant API calls are avoided. Additionally, these will be used by different components, such as paths. Vehicle tracking is externalized in other components, so that there is no information dependency.  

*   __Per-vehicle loop structure.__ Previously in Traffic Manager, the calculations were divided in global stages. They were self-contained, which made it difficult to save up computational costs. Later in the pipeline, stages had no knowledge of the vehicle calculations done previously. Changing these global stages to a per-vehicle structure makes it easier to implement features such as parallellization, as the processing of stages can be triggered externally.  

*   __Loop control.__ This per-vehicle structure brings another issue: synchronization between vehicles has to be guaranteed. For said reason, a component is created to control the loop of the vehicle calculations. This controller creates synchronization barriers that force each vehicle to wait for the rest to finish their calculations. Once all the vehicles are done, the following stage is triggered. That ensures that all the vehicle calculations are done in sync, and avoids frame delays between the processing cycle and the commands being applied.  

## ROS2 integration
---

The CARLA-ROS bridge now provides support for the new generation of ROS. This integration is still a work in progress, and the current state can be followed in the corresponding [ros2 branch](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge).


## Autoware integration improvements
---

The [CARLA-Autoware bridge](https://github.com/Autoware-AI/simulation/tree/master/carla_simulator_bridge) is now part of the official Autoware repository.
The Autoware bridge relies on the [CARLA ROS Bridge](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge) and its main objective is to establish the communication between
the CARLA world and Autoware (mainly through ROS datatypes conversions).

The [CARLA-Autoware repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware) contains an example of usage, with an Autoware agent ready to be used out-of-the-box. The agent is provided as a Docker image with all the necessary components already included. It features:  

*  Autoware 1.14.0.
*  The [Autoware content repository](https://bitbucket.org/carla-simulator/autoware-contents/src/master/). This repository contains additional data required to run Autoware with CARLA, such as point cloud maps, vector maps, and some configuration files.  
*  CARLA ROS bridge.

The agent's configuration, including sensor configuration, can be found [here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware/tree/master/carla-autoware-agent/agent).

#### Executing the agent

__1. Clone the [carla-autoware repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware).__  
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware
```
__2. Build the docker image.__
```sh
cd carla-autoware
./build.sh
```
__3. Run a CARLA server.__
You can either run the CARLA server in your host machine or within a Docker container. Find out more [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_docker/).

__4. Run the carla-autoware image.__ This will start an interactive shell inside the container.  

```sh
./run.sh
```
__5. Run the agent.__

```sh
roslaunch carla_autoware_agent carla_autoware_agent.launch town:=Town01
```

__6. Select the desired destination.__ Use the `2D Nav Goal` button in [RVIZ](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz). The output will be similar to the following.

## New RSS features
---

The RSS sensor in CARLA now has full support for [ad-rss-lib 4.0.x](https://github.com/intel/ad-rss-lib/releases), which includes two main features.  

*   __Unstructured roads__ — Scenarios were vehicles move in a route where no specific lanes are defined, or they are force to abandon these to avoid obstacles.

![rss_unstructured](/img/posts/2020-31-07/rss_unstructured.gif){:class="img-fluid"}

*   __Pedestrians__ — Moving in both structured and structured scenarios.  

![rss_pedestrians](/img/posts/2020-31-07/rss_pedestrians.gif){:class="img-fluid"}

Find out more about these features either in the original [RSS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06374), or reading the rss-lib documentation on [unstructured scenes](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/ad_rss/UnstructuredConstellations), and [behavior model for pedestrians](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/ad_rss/UnstructuredConstellations/#behavior-modeltrajectory-set-calculation).  

## Units of measurement in Python API docs
---

For the sake of clarity, the Python API docs now include the units of measurement used by parameters, variables and method returns. These appear inside the parenthesis, next to the type of the variable.  

![api_units](/img/posts/2020-31-07/api_units.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}

## Pedestrian gallery extension
---

This release includes the first iteration on a major extension of the pedestrian gallery. In order to recreate reality more accurately, one of our main goals is to provide with a more diverse set of walkers. Moreover, great emphasis is being put in the details: meticulous models, attention to facial features, new shaders and materials for their skin, hair, eyes... In summary, we want to make them, and therefore the simulation, feel alive.  

So far, there are three new models in the blueprint library, a sneak peek on what is to come. Take a look at the new additions!

## New sky atmosphere
---

The light values of the scene (sun, streetlights, buildings, cars...) have been adjusted to values closer to reality. Due to these changes, the default values of the RGB camera sensor have been balanced accordingly, so now its parameterization is also more realistic.

## Eye adaptation for RGB cameras
---

The default mode of the RGB cameras has changed to `auto exposure histogram`. In this mode, the exposure of the camera will be automatically adjusted depending on the lighting conditions. When changing from a dimly lit environment to a brightly lit one (or the other way around), the camera will adapt in a similar way the human eye does.

The eye adaptation can be disabled by changing the default value of the attribute `exposure_mode` from `histogram` to `manual`. This will allow to fix an exposure value that will not be affected by the luminance of the scene.  

```py
my_rgb_camera.set_attribute('exposure_mode','manual')
```
