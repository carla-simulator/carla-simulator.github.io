Happy 1 year CARLA: The expected CARLA 0.9.1 release is finally among us!

It has been a long journey for the CARLA simulator. The team started this adventure back at the end of 2016 aiming to bring a state-of-the-art Autonomous Driving simulator to the open source community. Our goals were clear: **democratising** Autonomous Driving via accessible simulation and creating a platform that enables academics and industry members to **share** knowledge and results in the open. In November of 2017 we made the first public release of CARLA. At that time, the platform was a humble simulator built around the use cases of camera-based policy learning and data acquisition tasks. A great starting point but not enough. Therefore, we decided to completely redesign the platform to produce a more advanced and flexible autonomous driving simulator, with the following objectives in mind:

- Users must be able to create ***new contents*** (aka maps, levels) in a simple fashion
- Users must be able to create complex ***traffic scenarios*** (aka traffic situations)
- Users must be able to leverage any ***existing sensor*** used in autonomous driving
- Users must be able to automatically train and ***assess*** their driving agents (driving stacks)
- The platform must be ***scalable***, i.e. computation is distributed among different nodes

We have dedicated the past 10 months to redesign the platform to achieve these objectives. The 0.9.0 release was an initial showcase of this effort, with the introduction of the new CARLA API, the multi-client architecture and the capacity of controlling all vehicles of the simulation at will.

In this 0.9.1 release, we have added critical features to enable the ingestion of new contents (maps) made with external tools and the simple ***navigation*** of these maps using a new API based on waypoints and map queries. To this end, we have adopted [ASAM OpenDRIVE][opendrivelink]{:target="_blank"} as the core of CARLA's road network format. Our map representation is built on top of [OpenDRIVE][opendrivelink]{:target="_blank"}, allowing for a easy-to-use and versatile navigation API. We also introduce ***Town03***, a complex urban scene with multi-lane roads, tunnels, roundabouts and many other interesting features, as an example of a map generated semi-automatically from an external tool.

Now let's dive in the new features of this release, and please beware this is still a **development release**!


### Driving simulation messages

All the driving messages produced by the server in the 0.8.X branch have been incorporated back as sensors to CARLA 0.9.1.  This enables the client to detect collisions and determine lane changes. Collisions against the static layout of the scene and dynamic objects like vehicles are detected by the new `sensor.other.collision`.

```
class CollisionSensor(object):
    """
    Encapsulate sensor.other.collision messages
    """
    def __init__(self, parent_actor):
        self._parent = parent_actor
        self._history = collections.defaultdict(int)

        bp = world.get_blueprint_library().find('sensor.other.collision')
        self._sensor = world.spawn_actor(bp, carla.Transform(), attach_to=self._parent)
        # We need to pass the lambda a weak reference to self to avoid circular
        # reference.
        weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
        self.sensor.listen(lambda event: CollisionSensor._on_collision(weak_self, event))

    @staticmethod
    def _on_collision(weak_self, event):
        self = weak_self()
        if not self:
            return
        actor_type = ' '.join(event.other_actor.type_id.replace('_', '.').title().split('.')[1:])
        self._hud.notification('Collision with %r' % actor_type)
        impulse = event.normal_impulse
        intensity = math.sqrt(impulse.x**2 + impulse.y**2 + impulse.z**2)
        self._history.append((event.frame_number, intensity))
        ...
```

In this example we will receive a message each time the `parent_actor` (a vehicle) crashes against other actor of the scene, indicating its ***type*** and the ***magnitude*** of the impact. This sensor also reports collisions against static elements of the map, such as traffic signs, walls, traffic lights, sidewalks, etc.

A new sensor `sensor.other.lane_detector` can be now used to detect ***lane changes***. New CARLA maps are more complex, containing multi-lane roads. In this context, it is important to detect when vehicles are changing lanes, determining which type of lanemarking the vehicle has crossed and what is the direction of the target lane. See code example below:

```
class LaneInvasionSensor(object):
    def __init__(self, parent_actor, hud):
        self.sensor = None
        self._parent = parent_actor
        self._hud = hud
        world = self._parent.get_world()
        bp = world.get_blueprint_library().find('sensor.other.lane_detector')
        self.sensor = world.spawn_actor(bp, carla.Transform(), attach_to=self._parent)
        # We need to pass the lambda a weak reference to self to avoid circular
        # reference.
        weak_self = weakref.ref(self)
        self.sensor.listen(lambda event: LaneInvasionSensor._on_invasion(weak_self, event))

    @staticmethod
    def _on_invasion(weak_self, event):
        self = weak_self()
        if not self:
            return
        text = ['%r' % str(x).split()[-1] for x in set(event.crossed_lane_markings)]
        self._hud.notification('Crossed line %s' % ' and '.join(text))
```


### Map and Waypoint representations

It is possible now to get access to a high-level representation of the road network via the ***Map*** class. Map objects let us get recommended spawning points for vehicles (places where it is safe to instantiate new objects):

```
map.get_spawn_points()
```

It also makes driving from client side very easy through the new waypoint querying API. In the code below we obtain the waypoint associated to the current location of an actor.

```
w = map.get_waypoint(location)
```

Users can also generate waypoints up to a given distance:

```
 map.generate_waypoints(distance)
```

And overall, users can make use of these new functions to create their own navigation algorithms:


```py
client = carla.Client(args.host, args.port)
client.set_timeout(2.0)

hud = HUD(args.width, args.height)
world = World(client.get_world(), hud)
world.vehicle.set_simulate_physics(False)

m = world.world.get_map()
w = m.get_waypoint(world.vehicle.get_location())

clock = pygame.time.Clock()
count = 0
while True:
    clock.tick_busy_loop(60)
    world.tick(clock)
    world.render(display)
    pygame.display.flip()
    if count % 10 == 0:
        nexts = list(w.next(1.0))
        print('Next(1.0) --> %d waypoints' % len(nexts))
        if not nexts:
            raise RuntimeError("No more waypoints!")
        w = random.choice(nexts)
        text = "road id = %d, lane id = %d, transform = %s"
        print(text % (w.road_id, w.lane_id, w.transform))
        if count % 40 == 0:
            draw_waypoints(world.world, w)
            count = 0
        t = w.transform
        world.vehicle.set_transform(t)
    count += 1
```

### Pipeline for semi-automatic map generation

One of the most exciting additions of this release is the compatibility with new maps created with external tools. We want users to easily create their own maps in CARLA. Towards this end we adopted [OpenDRIVE][opendrivelink]{:target="_blank"} as our map definition standard. Using a well-known standard reduces the effort needed to create new contents compatible with the CARLA simulator.

We have been collaborating closely with [VectorZero][vectorzerolink]{:target="_blank"} to guarantee full compatibility between [RoadRunner][roadrunnerlink]{:target="_blank"} and CARLA. RoadRunner is a tool that can produce complex driving maps in a few clicks thanks to its powerful procedural generation engine. What is best, it also produces the [OpenDRIVE][opendrivelink]{:target="_blank"} file associated to the 3D map, so maps produced by RoadRunner can be directly used in CARLA with all the functionalities available for the current towns.

VectorZero has commited to give free licenses to use RoadRunner for academic and research purposes to those academics who request it. So, check out their [website][vectorzerolink]{:target="_blank"} to obtain a license and start building your own maps!

#### Things missing

 * Full ***synchronous*** mode
 * Simulation of ***pedestrians***
 * Fully functional ***ROS*** bridge

These functionalities will be added very soon. We will keep improving this API in the coming releases. If you find any
issues or have suggestions that can be added, please do not hesitate to
share it with the community at our [GitHub][githubrepolink]{:target="_blank"} or
[Discord chat][discordlink]{:target="_blank"}. For the full list of methods available take a look at the [Python API Reference][apireflink]{:target="_blank"}.



**Big thanks to all our supporters and sponsors for making this project a reality. And happy 1 year CARLA!**
