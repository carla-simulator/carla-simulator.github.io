We are releasing a patch fixing some of the issues of 0.8.3

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.8.4" %}

#### Regressions fixed

Thanks to @minhaoxu1995 for catching something very obvious we missed, the new
Mustang model did not have the collisions enabled, therefore wasn't measuring
any collision. We fixed this and also made sure that no other vehicle has this
issue.

We have also put more effort into making bikes and motorbikes more stable, but
we are aware that they still cause issues when running long episodes, so we
added a method to disable two-wheeled vehicles altogether. This can be done by
adding the following to your _"CarlaSettings.ini"_

```ini
[CARLA/LevelSettings]
; Disable bikes and motorbikes, if true only four-wheeled

; vehicles will be spawned.

DisableTwoWheeledVehicles=true
```

#### Community contribution: ROS bridge

Thanks to George Laurent now we have ROS
([Robot Operating System][roslink]{:target="_blank"})
support!

It supports our current camera types (depth, semantic, and RGB), Lidar, and
bounding boxes. You can find more information in the
[ROS Bridge][rosblink]{:target="_blank"} folder in our main repository.

#### New vehicle model

Finally, since we are making a new release, we took the chance to add the latest
model in our car collection, a Tesla Model 3!
