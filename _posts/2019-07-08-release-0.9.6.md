We are proud to announce the new features included in **CARLA 0.9.6**!

{% include youtube.html id="NpEaa2P7qZI" %}

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.9.6" %}

This release adds many important features and improvements to CARLA. Let's take a detailed look at what's new!

## Behold the new pedestrian AI!

With this new feature it is now easier than before to control and to define the path that pedestrians will follow, which is now running on the client side!

There are a few types of pedestrians, male, female, both in kid and adult form. Also, they can spawn at random points over sidewalks and walk over them.

_Currently, it is not possible for pedestrians to cross the road, but it will be soon!_

![pedestrian_ai](/img/posts/2019-07-08/pedestrians.gif){:class="img-fluid"}

A new controller class has been created to manage the walker automatically.

```
carla.WalkerAIController:
  start()
  stop()
  go_to_location(destination)
  set_max_speed(speed)
```

To control a walker, it is just needed to spawn a `controller.ai.walker` and attach it to a walker actor, then initialize the controller and set its parameters.

```py
blueprintsWalkers = random.choice(world.get_blueprint_library().filter("walker.*"))
walker_controller_bp = world.get_blueprint_library().find('controller.ai.walker')

walker_actor = world.spawn_actor(walker_bp, spawn_point)
walker_controller_actor = world.spawn_actor(walker_controller_bp, carla.Transform(), walker_actor)

world.wait_for_tick()

walker_controller_actor.start()
walker_controller_actor.go_to_location(world.get_random_location_from_navigation())
walker_controller_actor.set_max_speed(1.4)

#...
```

> Code example 1. Spawning a pedestrian and setting its destination.

Once the simulation has started, pedestrians will walk to their destination and come back to the origin point continually.

You can test it out with the updated script **spawn_npc.py** which has the option to spawn pedestrians with the flag `-w`.

```py
> python spawn_npc.py -w 20
```

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api_tutorial/#pedestrians)!

## Improved Pedestrians

In Carla we are growing our family!

New pedestrians are joining our library of assets.
In addition to improving the looks of our previous citizens we are working on our future generations, boys and girls will populate our streets.

> Figure 1. Improved pedestrian

![new_kids](/img/posts/2019-07-08/kids_photo.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 2. New kids

Last we are working on pedestrian variations, we've planned different haircuts and clothing for each. Also, each piece of cloth will have different patterns and fabrics, new fashion trends and lots of styles.

![pedestrian_cloth_variations](/img/posts/2019-07-08/cloth_variation.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 3. Cloth variations

![pedestrian_skeleton](/img/posts/2019-07-08/pedestrian_cloth.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 4. Pedestrian cloth variations

## New skeleton

Now all pedestrian actors have the same standard skeleton hierarchy, the same animation clips will behave similarly and fit them all.

![pedestrian_skeleton](/img/posts/2019-07-08/pedestrian_skeleton.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 5. Pedestrian skeleton dance

We have added a new method that allows the user to take control of all the parts of a walker skeleton.

![skeleton_hierarchy](/img/posts/2019-07-08/skeleton_hierarchy.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 6. Skeleton hierarchy

A walker's skeleton can be modified by using an instance of the `WalkerBoneControl` class. This class contains the transforms of the bones to be modified (as a tuple).

```py
control = carla.WalkerBoneControl()
first_tuple = ('crl_hand__R', carla.Transform(rotation=carla.Rotation(roll=90)))
second_tuple = ('crl_hand__L', carla.Transform(rotation=carla.Rotation(roll=90)))
control.bone_transforms = [first_tuple, second_tuple]
```

In order to apply these changes to a walker:

```py
walker_actor.apply_control(control)
```

The location and rotation of each transform are relative to its parent. Therefore when a parent bone's transform is modified, the transforms of the child bones in model space will also be changed relatively.

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/walker_bone_control/)!

## Snapshots!

Now it is possible to know the state of every actor in the world at a certain frame. No need for synchronous mode to be active!

The world snapshot contains a timestamp and a list of actor snapshots.

```
carla.WorldSnapshot:
  id
  frame
  timestamp

  has_actor(actor_id)
  find(actor_id)
```

```py
# Retrieve a snapshot of the world at this point in time.

world_snapshot = world.get_snapshot()

# Wait for the next tick and retrieve the snapshot of the tick.

world_snapshot = world.wait_for_tick()

# Register a callback to get called every time we receive a new snapshot.

world.on_tick(lambda world_snapshot: do_something(world_snapshot))
```
> Code example 2. Retrieving a world snapshot.

Actor snapshots contain the data about the physical state of the actor, and it is possible to retrieve the actual actor through the id.

```
carla.ActorSnapshot:
  id

  get_transform()
  get_velocity()
  get_angular_velocity()
  get_acceleration()
```

In order to get an actor snapshot:

```py
> actor_snapshot = world_snapshot.find(actual_actor.id)
```

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api_tutorial/#world-snapshot)!

## Importing and exporting assets has never been easier!

With this new simplified pipeline it's easier to import and export **maps** & **props** and defining them in the Carla Blueprint Library.

### Importing

It is needed to place the files like the following structure.

```
Import
|
├── Package1
|   ├── MapToImport01
│   │   ├── Asphalt1_Diff.png
│   │   ├── Asphalt1_Norm.png
│   │   ├── Asphalt1_Spec.png
│   │   ├── Grass1_Diff.png
│   │   ├── Grass1_Norm.png
│   │   ├── Grass1_Spec.png
│   │   ├── LaneMarking1_Diff.png
│   │   ├── LaneMarking1_Norm.png
│   │   ├── LaneMarking1_Spec.png
│   │   ├── MapToImport01.fbx
│   │   └── MapToImport01.xodr
|   └── MapToImport02
│   │   ├── MapToImport02.fbx
│   │   └── MapToImport02.xodr
|   └── AssetsToImport
|       ├── PropToImport01
│       │   ├── PropToImport01_Diff.png
│       │   ├── PropToImport01_Norm.png
│       │   ├── PropToImport01_Spec.png
│       │   └── PropToImport01.fbx
│       ├── PropToImport02
│       │   └── PropToImport02.fbx
|       └── PropToImport03
│           └── PropToImport03.fbx
└── Package2
    └── AssetsToImport
        └── PropToImport04
            └── PropToImport04.fbx
```

> Project structure.

Finally, a JSON file needs to be created for each package, similar to the following:

```json
{
  "maps": [{
      "name": "MyTown01",
      "source": "./Town01/Town01.fbx",
      "use_carla_materials": true,
      "xodr": "./Town01/Town01.xodr"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyTown02",
      "source": "./Town02/Town02.fbx",
      "use_carla_materials": true,
      "xodr": "./Town02/Town02.xodr"
    }
  ],
  "props": [{
      "name": "MyProp01",
      "size": "medium",
      "source": "./MyProp01Mesh.fbx",
      "tag": "SegmentationTag01"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyProp02",
      "size": "small",
      "source": "MyProp02Mesh.fbx",
      "tag": "SegmentationTag02"
    }
  ]
}
```

The next command will read the JSON file and take each asset and place it inside the Content in Unreal Engine. It also creates a `Package.Package.json` file inside used for **defining** its props in the blueprint library, **exposing** them in the `Python API` and also **exporting** those assets if needed.

```sh
> make import
```

### Exporting

The following command will create the distribution packages compressed in a `.tar.gz` file for each cooked package and place it in _Carla/dist/_ folder.

```sh
> make package ARGS="--packages=Package1,Package2"
```

Finally, you could use these distribution packages in the Carla distribution packages by simply moving them in the Carla `Import` folder and executing the `ImportAssets.sh` script.

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/export_import_dist/)!

## Carla docker build

We've added a new way to compile carla. In a docker!

<b>We use _ue4-docker_ to use Unreal Engine inside Docker, that's why images produced by the python package that contain UE4 Engine Tools, are prohibited from public distribution. </b>

The tutorial can be found in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carla_docker/)!

## Updated Synchronous mode

We have made a few modifications to the synchronous mode.

Now `tick` and `apply_settings` synchronize automatically with the server so there is no need that users manually wait for tick. Therefore the old recipe using `wait_for_tick` is no longer working.

For more information and examples go to our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring_the_simulation/#synchronous-mode)!

## New python API reference

Finally, we have added a new section to our documentation. It is indeed the new python API reference, a compendium of all the client-side API methods.

![python_api_reference](/img/posts/2019-07-08/python_API.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Check it out in our [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/)!
