The CARLA team is thrilled to release __CARLA 0.9.9__! Buckle up, because it comes ready to drift!  

The development has been brief but intense. There are plenty of announces to make, some of great importance. Especially remarkable is the new map ingestion proccess. This has been simplified for users to use their maps in CARLA out-of-the-box. Traffic lights and traffic signs will nevermore require users' manual intervention. Instead, CARLA can now automatically ingest these traffic landmarks directly from OpenDRIVE.  

Moreover, previous features and modules are growing strong. The RSS sensor, SUMO co-simulation, OpenDRIVE standalone mode, and Traffic Manager all have new features, and improved performance. There is even a new integration with PTV-Vissim. The documentation keeps up to date with all of these improvements, and features new tutorials. Last but not least, there is a new map in CARLA. __It is opening day in Town10HD!__ 

Here is a summary of every feature included in CARLA 0.9.9!

## LIDAR sensor upgrade
---

The LIDAR sensor now includes some additional attributes that make it feature a more realistic behavior.  

*   __Noise__ *(`noise_stddev` LIDAR attribute)*  
This attribute simulates unexpected deviations that appear when taking real-life measurements. If the noise is positive, the location of each point will be randomly perturbed along the vector of the ray detecting it.  

*   __Intensity__ *(`raw_data` output attribute)*  
The output data retrieved by the LIDAR sensor is now a 4D array of points. The fourth dimension contains the intensity of the ray when the point detected was reached. The intensity is reduced over time as the ray travels according to the formula:  
`intensity / original_intensity = e * (-attenuation_coef * distance)`  
The coefficient of attenuation can be modified with the LIDAR attribute:  
`atmosphere_attenuation_rate`.  

*   __Drop-off__ *(`dropoff_general_rate`, `dropoff_intensity_limit`, `dropoff_zero_intensity` LIDAR attributes)*  
Cloud points can be dropped cloud points. This is done in two different ways. In a general way, 
	*   __General drop-off__ — A random drop-off done before the tracing, meaning the points being dropped are not calculated. This drop-off is expressed with a proportion. If `dropoff_general_rate = 0.5`, half the points will be dropped.  
	*   __Instensity-based drop-off__ — For each point detected, a calculation is done to determine whereas it should be dropped. Two parameters determine the result. `dropoff_zero_intensity` is the probability of points with zero intensity to be dropped. `dropoff_intensity_limit` is a threshold intensity where no points will be dropped. The probability of a point within the range to be dropped is a linear proportion based on these two parameters.

## Rendering pipeline optimization
---

In order to improve the performance of the RGB camera sensors, some adjustments in the rendering pipeline were needed. These cameras retrieve a texture, generated in the GPU, which is sent to the CPU when required. These textures are now coded in an atlas and sent all-together at the end of the rendering pipeline. Thus, the amount of times the GPU has to pause calculations to send textures is less, and these pauses do not happen mid-cycle. Additionally, some changes in the map geometry have been made, so that cameras require less time to paint the scene. 

Thanks to these improvements, the simulation can feature multiple cameras without huge FPS drop-offs. For instance, here is CARLA running with four RGB cameras rendering in real-time at X FPS.

## OpenStreetMap integration
---

*This feature is still in experimental phase.*

OpenStreetMap is an open license map of the world developed by contributors. Sections of these map can be exported to an XML file in `.osm` format. CARLA can convert this file to OpenDRIVE format and ingest it as any other OpenDRIVE map using the [OpenDRIVE Standalone Mode](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_opendrive/). The process is detailed in the [documentation](!!link), but here is a summary.  

*   __1  + Obtain a map with OpenStreetMap__ — Go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) to generate an XML file containing the map information.  

*   __2  + Convert to OpenDRIVE format__ CARLA can read a XML file generated with OpenStreetMap, and easily convert it to OpenDRIVE format.  

*   __3  + Import into CARLA__ – The OpenDRIVE file can be automatically ingested in CARLA using the [OpenDRIVE Standalone Mode](#adv_opendrive.md), either using a customized script of the `config.py` example provided in CARLA.  

In order to do the conversion from `.osm` to `.xodr` format, two classes have been added to the Python API.  

*   __[carla.Osm2Odr](python_api.md#carla.osm2odr)__ – The class that does the conversion. It takes the content of the `.osm` parsed as strind, and returns a string containing the resulting `.xodr`.  
	*   `osm_file` — The content of the initial `.osm` file parsed as string.  
	*   `settings` — A [carla.Osm2OdrSettings](python_api.md#carla.Osm2OdrSettings) object containing the settings to parameterize the conversion.  
*   __[carla.Osm2OdrSettings](python_api.md#carla.Osm2OdrSettings)__ – Helper class that contains different parameters used during the conversion.  
	*   `use_offsets` *(default False)* — Determines whereas the map should be generated with an offset, thus moving the origin from the center according to that offset.  
	*   `offset_x` *(default 0.0)* — Offset in the X axis.  
	*   `offset_y` *(default 0.0)* — Offset in the Y axis.  
	*   `default_lane_width` *(default 4.0)* — Determines the width that lanes should have in the resulting XODR file.  
	*   `elevation_layer_height` *(default 0.0)* — Determines the height separating elements in different layers, used for overlapping elements. Read more on [layers](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer).  

## Plug-in repository
---

https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-plugins


## carlaviz plug-in
---

The carlaviz plugin is used to visualize the simulation in a web browser. This plug-in was created by the contributor [wx9698](https://github.com/wx9698), and it is maintained in the [carlaviz repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carlaviz/tree/edfa95dd974be96039601a1137842c3813bdb227). When using it, a window with some basic representation of the scene is created. Actors are updated on-the-fly, sensor data can be retrieved, and additional text, lines and polylines can be drawn in the scene. There is detailed [carlaviz documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins_carlaviz/) already available, but here is a brief summary on how to run the plug-in and the output it provides.  

__1. Run CARLA.__  

__2. Run carlaviz.__ In another terminal run the following command according to the Docker image that has been downloaded. Edit the comand to match the Docker image being used.  

Change `<name_of_Docker_image>` for the name of the image previously downloaded, e.g. `carlasim/carlaviz:latest` or `mjxu96/carlaviz:0.9.9`.  

```sh
docker run -it --network="host" -e CARLAVIZ_HOST_IP=localhost -e CARLA_SERVER_IP=localhost -e CARLA_SERVER_PORT=2000 <name_of_Docker_image>
```
__3. Open the localhost__ Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. carlaviz runs by default in port `8080`.  

Once the plug-in is operative, it can be used to visualize the simulation, the actors that live in it, and the data the sensors retrieve. The plug-in shows a visualization window on the right, were the scene is updated in real-time, and a sidebar on the left with a list of items to be shown. Some of these items will appear in the visualization window, others (mainly sensor and game data) appear just above the items list. The result will look similar to the following image. 


## Traffic Manager 2.0
---

For this iteration, the inner structure and logic of the Traffic Manager module has been remodeled. The details these changes are explained in the [Traffic Manager documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_traffic_manager/). Here is a brief summary on the principles that set the ground for the new architecture.  

*   __Data query centralization.__ The first and foremost component in the new TM 2.0 logic is the ALSM. This component takes care of all the server calls necessary to get the current state of the simulation. Everything that will be needed further on: lists of vehicles and walkers, their position and velocity, static attributes such as bounding boxes, etc. Everything is queried by the ALSM and stored in cache so that cost is reduced, and redundant API calls avoided. Additionally, later on information that will be used by different components, such as paths, or vehicle tracking is externalized in other components, so that there is no information dependency.  

*   __Per-vehicle loop structure.__ Previously in Traffic Manager, the calculations were divided in global stages. Calculations were self-contained, which made it difficult to save up costs. Going downstream, later stages had no knowledge of the vehicle calculations done previously. Changing this global stages to a per-vehicle structure makes it easier to implement things such as parallellization, as the processing of stages can be triggered externally.  

*   __Loop control.__ This per-vehicle structure brings another issue: synchronization between vehicles has to be guaranteed. For said reason, a component is created to control the loop of the vehicle calculations. This controller creates synchronization barriers that force each vehicle to wait for the rest to finish their calculations. Once all the vehicles are done, the folowing stage is triggered. That ensures that there all the vehicle calculations are done in sync, and there is no frame delay between the processing cycle and the commands being applied.  

## ROS2 integration
---

## Autoware integration improvements
---

The [Autoware-CARLA bridge](https://github.com/Autoware-AI/simulation/tree/master/carla_simulator_bridge) is part of the Autoware repository. However, the bridge does nothing by itself, as it is only in charge of communication between Autoware and ROS. The integration needs for some elements to run.  

*   The [Autoware repository](https://github.com/Autoware-AI/autoware.ai). This already contains the Autoware-CARLA bridge.  

*   The [Autoware content repository](https://bitbucket.org/carla-simulator/autoware-contents/src/master/). This contains the CARLA maps ready to be used in Autoware. As Autoware does not use XODR maps, these have to be translated to point cloud and vector maps, with some additional configuration files.  

*   An Autoware agent which describes the ego vehicle and the sensor setting.  

*   Some basic launch files for the agent, and configuration files describing the topics being published and their name translation between Autoware and ROS.  

*   A CARLA server with the CARLA-ROS bridge enabled.  

In order to ease the usage of these integration, the [__carla-autoware repository__](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware) provides with an Autoware imagen, and an Autoware agent ready to be used. In order to run the example Autoware agent, follow these steps.  

__1. Clone the [carla-autoware repository](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware).__  This repository already contains all thar is needed: an Autoware image, the Autoware content, and a basic Autoware agent that can be edited.  
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla-autoware
```

__2. Build the repository.__
```sh
cd carla-autoware
./build.sh
```

__3. Run a CARLA server with ROS bridge enabled.__ Alternatively, a CARLA docker image can be used. Find out more [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_docker/).

__4. Run the Autoware image in the repository.__
```sh
./run.sh
```

__5. Launch the agent.__ 
```sh
roslaunch carla_autoware_agent carla_autoware_agent.launch
```

Additionally, the [carlaviz plug-in](#carlaviz-plug-in) can be used for visualization.

## New RSS features
---

The RSS sensor in CARLA now has full support for [ad-rss-lib 4.0.x](https://github.com/intel/ad-rss-lib/releases), which includes two main features.  

*   __Unstructured roads__ — In summary, scenarios were vehicles move in a route where no specific lanes are defined. 
*   __Pedestrians__ — Moving in both structured and structured scenarios.  

Find out more about these features either in the original [RSS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06374) or reading the rss-lib documentation on [unstructured scenes](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/ad_rss/UnstructuredScenes/), and [behavior model for pedestrians](https://intel.github.io/ad-rss-lib/ad_rss/UnstructuredScenes/#behavior-modeltrajectory-calculation).  


## Pedestrian module expansion
---

The CARLA team is currently working on a major extension of the pedestrian module. Our goal is not only to provide a more diverse set of walkers, which is important to recreate reality accurately. The focus is also in the details: more detailed models and animations, new shaders and materials for their skin, hair, eyes... In summary, we want to make them, and therefore the simulation, feel alive.  

So far, there are three new models in the blueprint library, a sneak peek on what is to come. Let's see how things are going!  


## New Sky atmosphere
---

The lighting of the simulation has been adjusted so that values are closer to reality (at least, what can achieved in Unreal Engine). These changes required some balancing in the default values of the RGB camera sensor, so that they react properly to the new light values.  

These changes also made the RGB camera a bit more difficult to manage by users. For instance, when changing to night mode, the attributes of the camera should be changed accordingly. Otherwise, the images rendered would look too dark. In order to make up for these extra troubles, the lighting of the scene is not consistent for all the weather conditions. The new realistic values are actually used in midday conditions, but then altered to fit other ambiences such as night or dawn.  

In summary, the new sky atmosphere recreates an ambience which is not only trying to look real, but actually use realistic values. However, these changes are not permanent, but change depending on weather conditions so that the users do not have to constantly update the RGB camera attributes to fit the lighting.
