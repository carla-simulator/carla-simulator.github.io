The __0.9.14 release of CARLA__ has landed and we think you'll be just as excited as we are about it!

At CARLA, we are scaling things up! The latest version of CARLA brings a brand new [__Large Map__](http://localhost:4000/2021/08/02/release-0.9.12/#large-maps), with an unprecedented scale and level of detail. [__Town 12__](#town-12) is 10x10 km<sup>2</sup> and boasts a diverse range of environments from urban high-rise to rural corn fields. You'll be amazed by the size and detail! 

Continuing with the theme of scaling up, __0.9.14__ now supports [__multiple GPUs__](#multi-gpu) for setting up high-performance CARLA workstations.

CARLA 0.9.14 brings further diversity and realism to your traffic simulations with a brand new public transit vehicle - the [__Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa bus__](#mitsubishi-fuso-rosa-bus). 

This version of CARLA includes [__new semantic classes__](#new-semantic-segmentation-classes) to further differentiate vehicle types. Buses, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles and riders now have their own semantic IDs and colors matching the [__CityScapes__](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/#features) color pallette.

[__N-wheeled vehicles__](#n-wheeled-vehicles) are now supported by CARLA's engine, enabling users to import models of heavy goods and industrial vehicles with 3 or more axles. 

And last but not least, version 0.9.14 comes with numerous fixes and improvements. CARLA now has an Ackermann control built into the API, additional 


## Town 12

Town 12 is the newest addition to the CARLA asset library. Leveraging the [__Large Map__](http://localhost:4000/2021/08/02/release-0.9.12/#large-maps) functionality introduced in CARLA version 0.9.12, Town 12 boasts a diverse range of highly detailed environments including the following regions:

__High-rise central business district__:

Town 12's central business district is a large area of high rise skyscrapers arranged into blocks on a consistent grid of roads,resembling downtown areas in many large American and European cities.

__High density residential__:

The high density residential areas of Town 12 have many 2-10 storey apartment buildings with commercial properties like cafes and retail stores at street level.

__Low density residential__:

The low density residential regions of Town 12 reflect the classic suburbs of many American cities, with one and two story homes surrounded by fenced gardens and garages.

__Highway and intersections__:

Town 12 has an extensive highway system, including 3-4 lane highways interspersed with impressive roundabout junctions.

__Rural and farmland__:

Town 12 also has rural regions with characteristic farmland buildings like wooden barns and farmhouses, windmills, grain silos, corn fields, hay bails and rural fencing.

## Multi GPU

![multi_gpu](/img/posts/2022-12-16/gpu_info.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

The CARLA simulator can now be distributed across multiple GPU devices. Multiple synchronized instances of the simulator can be run on different GPUs, with the sensor workload distributed evenly over the graphics cards. High performance CARLA workstations can be built using multi-gpu server hardware.

## New Semantic Segmentation Classes

CARLA now has new semantic classes for that extra ground truth fidelity, assisting in the classification of different types of vehicle. The semantic class list now includes separate classes for cars, trucks and busses, along with new classes for motorcycles, bicycles and their riders. 

The semantic class list has 5 new members and associated colors:

- car (replaces the previous 'vehicle' class) - RGB: 0, 0, 142
- truck - RGB: (0, 0, 70)
- bus - RGB: (0, 60, 100)
- motorcycle - RGB: (0, 0, 230)
- bicycle - RGB: (119, 11, 32)
- rider - RGB: (255, 0, 0)

## Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa bus

The CARLA garage presents a brand new public transit vehicle. The Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa is a widely used 20-25 seat bus, used by both private travel companies and public transport authorities around the world with tens of thousands produced every year.

## N-wheeled Vehicles

Carla can support vehicles with more than 4 wheels


CARLA now has the capacity to import vehicles with more than for wheels. This means that users can now develop models of heavy goods and industrial vehicles with 3 or more axels.

## New camera Post Processing Effects

CARLA camera sensors can now simulate the distorting effects of rain and dust contamination of the lens, adding an extra level of realism to your training data and presenting challenges for testing your AD stacks. 

## Improvements and fixes

As with every CARLA release, we continue our efforts to improve the workflow and fix bugs. The following are some key improvements and fixes:

__New vehicle attributes__:

Vehicle blueprints now have new attributes to help organize and filter them better:

- `base_type` can be use as a vehicle classification. The possible values are  *car*, *truck*, *van*, *motorcycle* and *bicycle*.
- `special_type` provides more information about the vehicle. It is currently restricted to *electric*, *emergency* and *taxi*, and not all vehicles have this attribute filled.
- `has_dynamic_doors` can either be *true* or *false* depending on whether or not the vehicle has doors that can be opened using the API.
- `has_lights` works in the same way as *has_dynamic_doors*, but differentiates between vehicles with lights, and those that don't. 

__Native Ackermann controller__:

The CARLA API now has methods for applying Ackermann controls to a vehicle:

- `apply_ackermann_control`:  to apply an Ackermann control command to a vehicle
- `get_ackermann_controller_settings`: to get the last Ackermann controller settings applied
- `apply_ackermann_controller_settings`: to apply new Ackermann controller settings

__New Traffic Manager methods__:

The Traffic Manager has new methods to offset the vehicle from the lane center:

- `vehicle_lane_offset(actor, offset)`
- `global_lane_offset(offset)`
