We are releasing a patch fixing some of the issues of 0.8.3

{% include release_button.html release_tag="0.8.4" %}

Thanks to @minhaoxu1995 for catching something very obvious we missed, the new
Mustang model did not have the collisions enabled, therefore wasn't measuring
any collision. We fixed this and also made sure that no other vehicle has this
issue.

We have also put more effort into making bikes and motorbikes more stable, but
we are aware they still cause issues when running long episodes, so we added a
method to disable two-wheeled vehicles altogether. This can be done by adding to
your _"CarlaSettings.ini"_ the following

```ini
[CARLA/LevelSettings]
; Disable bikes and motorbikes, if true only four-wheeled

; vehicles will be spawned.

DisableTwoWheeledVehicles=true
```

###### New vehicle model

And since we are making a new release, we took the chance to add the latest
model in our car collection, a Tesla Model 3!
