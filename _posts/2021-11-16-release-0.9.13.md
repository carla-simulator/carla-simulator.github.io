The __0.9.13 release of CARLA__ is finally here, so read on to see how the new improvements will revolutionize your workflow. 

CARLA now features ground truth [__instance segmentation__](#instance-segmentation)!. A new camera sensor can be used to output images with the semantic tag and a unique ID for each world object embedded in the channels of the image file. Now the ground truth ID is available to differentiate objects of the same type in the camera field of view for training and evaluating networks to differentiate  and track overlapping objects of the same class. 

[__Runtime texture streaming__](#runtime-texture-streaming) is now possible through the CARLA API. This new functionality enables the texture mapped to objects in the scene to be updated at runtime without requiring the Unreal Editor. Produce high quality training data to improve generalization, avoid overfitting pitfalls and challenge neural networks with adversarial attacks through continuously updating textures.

CARLA's API now provides new functions to retrieve [__ground truth pedestrian 3D bone positions__](#3d-ground-truth-skeletons-for-pedestrians) and hence evaluate the 3D pose, facilitating the validation and training of pose estimation models and also adding custom gestures to standard animations through the API. 

CARLA 0.9.13 presents new assets to enrich your simulations with a selection of additional vehicles and pedestrians. [__4 new pedestrians__](#new-pedestrians) are introduced including 2 adults (each with 3 variants) and 2 children to add extra variety to the humans occupying the pavements and roads in your simulations! [__2 new vehicles__](#new-vehicles) have also been added to the CARLA garage, the __Volkswagen T2 2021__ and a new __Ford Crown Taxi__ and Generation 2 (GEN-2) cars now include [__articulated doors__](#articulated-doors) that can interact with the environment through collisions, especially useful for training and testing autonomous vehicles in car parks or on tight city streets. 

This release comes with major improvements to the traffic manager, with new logic to promote [__more realistic vehicle behavior at intersections and at high speeds__](#improved-traffic-manager-logic). The API now offers new functionality to guide vehicles with a __user defined route or path__ and __vehicle lights__ now react to weather conditions and junctions. Vehicle physics has been enhanced with [__more accurate models of acceleration, gear and braking behavior.__](#improved-vehicle-behavior)

[__Installation improvements__](#python-library-updates) - following a continued commitment to improve the useability of the CARLA simulator the core CARLA Python API library is now available for Python version 3.9 through the native Python package installer PIP.


## Instance Segmentation

CARLA now has a brand new instance segmentation sensor that outputs images containing a different ID for every object of the same type. Instance semantic IDs are now available embedded in the G and B channels of the RGB output of the sensor data, alongside the standard semantic IDs in the R channel. The new functionality provides access to the ground truth identity of objects traversing the sensor field of view, enabling training, improvement and evaluation of instance semantic segmentation networks. This new functionality brings a whole new world of possibilities for training machine learning algorithms to differentiate overlapping objects in scenes.

## Runtime Texture Streaming

The API now exposes functionality to update textures during runtime to allow texture modification without relying on the UE4 editor. Textures can now be updated and modified programmatically through the API, allowing texture updating to occur for example during the execution of a neural network training script. This can be useful for example when training and validating neural networks to avoid overfitting pitfalls, tuning networks to focus more on shape and form rather than color or texture. Continuously updating textures can be used to challenge neural networks with adversarial attacks.

```py

# Get names of all available objects

object_names = world.get_names_of_all_objects()
    for name in object_names:
        print(name)

# Choose an object to modify
# For example target_object could be 'SM_Cartel_Add_5'

target_object = random.choice(object_names)
print('Altering texture for object: ' + target_object)

# Modify its texture

texture = carla.TextureColor(width,height)
for x in range(0,len(image[0])):
    for y in range(0,len(image)):
        color = image[y][x]
        r = int(color[0])
        g = int(color[1])
        b = int(color[2])
        a = int(color[3])
        texture.set(x, height - y - 1, carla.Color(r,g,b,a))
world.apply_color_texture_to_object(target_object, carla.MaterialParameter.Diffuse, texture, 0)
```

## 3D Ground Truth Skeletons for Pedestrians

The CARLA API now provides functionality to retrieve the ground truth 3D bone positions of pedestrians in the simulation. This opens up a wealth of possibilities for training and evaluation of human pose estimation models. A CARLA vehicle can now record the bone positions of nearby pedestrians to complement it's sensor data with access to the ground truth 3D pose for comparison with model-estimated poses. This new functionality also allows easy augmentation of pedestrian behavior with custom gestures blended into the default animations like waving or pointing. 

The following animation shows a custom animation handled by the CARLA API retrieving the bones then blending between the neutral pose and a custom walking animation handled through the API:

![pedestrian_animation](/img/posts/2021-11-07/skeleton.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

The following code spawns two pedestrians from the blueprint library and then retrieves the 3D skeletons and alter's the arms' pose:

```py
# create several pedestrians

blueprints = world.get_blueprint_library().filter("walker.pedestrian.*")
pedestrians = []
pedestrians.append(world.spawn_actor(random.choice(blueprints), world.get_random_location_from_navigation()))
pedestrians.append(world.spawn_actor(random.choice(blueprints), world.get_random_location_from_navigation()))
...

# get the 3d bones from all pedestrians

for ped in pedestrians:
  bones = ped.get_bones()

  # modify some bones

  new_pose = []
  for bone in bones.bone_transforms:
      if bone.name == "crl_foreArm__L":
          bone.relative.rotation.pitch -= 90
          new_pose.append((bone.name, bone.relative))
      elif bone.name == "crl_foreArm__R":
          bone.relative.rotation.pitch -= 90
          new_pose.append((bone.name, bone.relative))

  # set the new pose

  control = carla.WalkerBoneControlIn()
  control.bone_transforms = new_pose
  ped.set_bones(control)

  # blend the pose

  actor.blend_pose(0.5)

```

## New CARLA assets

### New Pedestrians

4 new pedestrians have been added to the CARLA assets. 2 adults (each with 3 variants) and 2 children. 

![neew_pedestrians](/img/posts/2021-11-07/new_pedestrians.jpg){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

### New Vehicles

The CARLA garage has built two exciting new vehicles, a high fidelity version of the __Volkswagen T2 2021__ and the __Ford Crown Taxi__. Add some charm to your city traffic with this beautiful new vehicles. 

![new_vehicles](/img/posts/2021-11-07/new_vehicles.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}


### Articulated Doors

All GEN-2 vehicles now have articulated doors that can be opened and closed through functions in the API. This functionality is ideal for simulating scenarios in busy city streets and car parks where doors may open unpredictably while driving past or might be blocking access to parking spaces or passageways.

## Improved Traffic Manager Logic

The traffic manager has undergone a major update with enhanced logic for handling vehicle behavior. Traffic now behaves in a more realistic manner at intersections and junctions with vehicles driving fluidly through road complex junctions at higher speeds. Vehicle turning is now improved to adapt much better at high speeds with smoother motion on tight bends. Collision detection and braking at high speeds is enhanced to promote more realistic rapid traffic behavior. Altogether the traffic manager improvements in this CARLA update yields far more realistic simulated NPC traffic.

### User Defined Paths in Traffic Manager

The traffic manager has been extended with some great new functionality to user control over the behavior of vehicles. The API now exposes new traffic manager functions that can be used to guide vehicles with a user-defined custom path.

New functions:

- `get_next_action`: gets the next action that a vehicle will take
- `get_all_actions`: enables the user to query all possible actions a vehicle has available
- `set_path`: allows a custom route to be defined using coordinates defined as CARLA Locations
- `set_route`: allows a custom route to be defined using route commands like `left`, `right` or `straight`

```py
path = [carla.Location(x=-506.696198, y=179.384308, z=0.038194),
                    carla.Location(x=-504.745972, y=232.868927, z=0.039417)]
traffic_manager.set_path(vehicle, path)
```
The `set_route` function allows a custom route to be defined using route commands:

```py
route = ["Right", "Straight", "Right", "Right", "Left", "Right"]
 traffic_manager.set_route(vehicle, route)
```

![set_route](/img/posts/2021-11-07/set_route.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

### Automatic vehicle lights for NPCs

The traffic manager now has functionality to control vehicle lights. Headlights, fog lights and indicators are controlled according to vehicle route data and weather conditions. Indicator lights will activate according to the next planned turn in the route, braking lights will activate when vehicle brakes are applied and fog lights and main beams are activated according to the weather and light conditions. During night vehicles' main beams are activated and in foggy conditions the rear fog lights are activated.

## Improved Vehicle Behavior

Vehicle physics has been improved with better modelled acceleration, braking and gear performance. Vehicle behavior has been carefully remodelled to better capture the technical characteristics of the CARLA garage vehicles’ real world counterparts, with much care taken to reproduce published performance data on acceleration and braking as accurately as possible. Similarly the gear change behavior has been altered to better reflect real world driving.

## Python Library Updates

Continued improvement in the useability of the CARLA Python API comes with access to the Python 3.9 version of the library for Linux and Windows, available through the convenient PIP package manager. 

```sh
pip install carla #now works for Python Version 3.9
```
