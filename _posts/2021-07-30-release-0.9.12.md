The long-anticipated __0.9.12 Release of CARLA__ is finally here!! And it was worth the wait! Let's have a peek at what the newest release brings.

Starting with the most exciting feature of this release, __Large Maps!__ Users can now perform simulations on vast maps that span kilometers and kilometers. You'll be able to try it out straight away in the new __Town 11__, a massive map that measures 20km x 20km. Use the __updated Traffic Manager__ to populate the map with hundreds of cars that can drive at high speeds!

Next, we have lots of __physics improvements__, including __physics determinism__ in synchronous mode, __improved wheel physics__, __custom vehicle wheel settings__, and __vehicle control telemetry__. 

We have some updates to the CARLA structure with an __upgrade of Unreal Engine__, new options to install the __Python client library__, a __rebrand of our classic script__ to populate scenes, and __a new default town__.

The blueprint library is expanding rapidly. We have a whole __new generation of pedestrians and vehicles__ with improved meshes and details. There's a lot of variety in our new pedestrians, who have a range of clothing, body shapes, and skin colors. 

The sensor library has expanded too, with the addition of the __Optical Flow Camera__, allowing you to capture the motion of pixels between frames. 

__OpenStreetMaps__ functionality has been extended to allow users to generate traffic lights at junctions and control how and where those traffic lights are generated. This feature uses both OpenStreetMap information and CARLA-generated information when the former isn't available.

Finally, we have two new integrations; __RLlib__ and __Chrono__. RLlib will help you use CARLA as an  environment for Ray experiments for training and inference. Chrono is a beta integration that allows users to simulate physics with the Project Chrono simulation engine.

We hope you enjoy the new 0.9.12 release of CARLA. Read on below to find out more!

## Large Maps

The large map feature is the most exciting of all in CARLA 0.9.12. Users can now perform simulations on a vast scale, complete with realistic traffic simulation. This CARLA release comes with a huge new map called __Town 11__, sized 20km x 20km, ready for users to explore straight away!

Large maps are constructed from many tiles, each with a maximum size of 2km x 2km. Tiles are streamed in and out of the simulation according to their distance from the hero vehicle. The streaming distance is configurable through the [Python API](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.WorldSettings.tile_stream_distance).

![large_map](/img/posts/2021-07-30/large_map_image.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

The hero vehicle not only controls the streaming of the tiles but also the state of other actors in the simulation. In large maps, actors can be active or dormant. It is important to note that dormant actors exist only within the context of large maps. Actors in the simulation become dormant when they are located outside of the area of influence of the hero vehicle and wake up when the hero vehicle is near them again. This distance is called the `actor_active_distance` and is configurable via the [Python API](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.WorldSettings.actor_active_distance). Traffic Manager actors are special because they can be respawned near the hero vehicle once they become dormant, or they can be set to hybrid mode, so they continue to teleport around the map while dormant.

Traffic manager has been adapted to populate the extensive road systems involved in large maps and has been upgraded to perform at high speeds, reacting realistically to curves, junctions, and other traffic while maintaining performance. Read more in the [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_traffic_manager/#traffic-manager-in-large-maps).

## Physics Determinism and Improvements

There have been several improvements in physics performance in the 0.9.12 release.

First up, collisions are fully deterministic when certain conditions are met. To achieve determinism, the simulation should be synchronous from the beginning of every simulation, with fixed delta seconds defined. Commands should be issued in batch to avoid loss during heavy computation load. Read more about the requirements in the [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_synchrony_timestep/#physics-determinism).

![determinism_crash](/img/posts/2021-07-30/determinism_crash.gif){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Several parameters have been exposed through the Python API that allow users fine-grained control over how physics affects vehicle wheels. These parameters include:

- `long_stiff_value`: Tire longitudinal stiffness per unit gravitational acceleration.
- `lat_stiff_max_load`: Maximum normalized tire load at which the tire can deliver no more lateral stiffness no matter how much extra load is applied to the tire.
- `lat_stiff_value`: Maximum stiffness per unit of lateral slip.

Each of our vehicles now has custom values for these parameters, but you can tweak them in your code by following the [example in the documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_G_control_vehicle_physics/)!

For users simulating physics through another engine, we have exposed the [`set_wheel_steer_direction`](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Vehicle.set_wheel_steer_direction) method on the Python API. This method controls the visual angle of a vehicle's wheels, without affecting physics. Each wheel is targeted individually. To use this method, you must have physics disabled on the vehicle first:

```py
vehicle.set_simulate_physics(False)
vehicle.set_wheel_steer_direction(carla.VehicleWheelLocation.FR_Wheel, 40.0)
```

A new telemetry view has been introduced to allow users to view physics and control metrics for a given actor in the server and simulation windows. This can be enabled simply through the [Python API](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Actor.show_debug_telemetry), or you can try it out in `manual_control.py` by pressing `T`. Read more in the [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_G_control_vehicle_physics/#viewing-vehicle-telemetry)!

![vehicle_telemetry](/img/posts/2021-07-30/vehicle_telemetry.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Finally, general simulation performance has been improved for actors whose physics has been disabled. This is most notable in the performance of hybrid mode in Traffic Manager.

## Unreal Engine 4.26

We have upgraded to Unreal Engine 4.26.2, bringing some important changes to the graphics API and rendering pipeline. Vulkan is now the only supported Graphics API; support for OpenGL has been dropped completely.

The upgrade to the Unreal Engine version has made off-screen rendering easier than ever with the Vulkan API. To run CARLA in off-screen mode, simply use the `-RenderOffScreen` flag when you start a CARLA server: 

```sh
./CarlaUE4.sh -RenderOffScreen
```

0.9.12 uses a fork of Unreal Engine 4.26 with custom changes specific for the CARLA simulator. Take this into account when building from source as this requires downloading our specific Unreal Engine [repository](https://github.com/CarlaUnreal/UnrealEngine)!

## Optical Flow Camera

The Optical Flow camera is a new sensor that captures the motion perceived from the point of view of the camera. Every pixel recorded by the Optical Flow camera encodes the velocity of that point projected to the image plane. You can find the sensor reference material and additional attributes [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref_sensors/#optical-flow-camera).

![optical_flow](/img/posts/2021-07-30/optical_flow.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

## New and Improved Vehicles

The CARLA garage has been busy with five new vehicles added to the CARLA blueprint library!

![vehicles](/img/posts/2021-07-30/vehicles.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Introducing from left to right:

- Firetruck
- Mini Cooper 2021
- Nissan Patrol 2021
- Ambulance
- Mercedes Sprinter

As well as completely new vehicles, we have generally improved the vehicle materials and meshes. Dirt has been added to vehicle exteriors to increase realism. Mesh geometry has been increased to improve appearance.

Finally, some of our vehicle names have changed in the blueprint library. These changes include:

- `vehicle.bmw.isetta -> vehicle.micro.microlino`
- `vehicle.dodge_charger.police -> vehicle.dodge.charger_police`
- `vehicle.mercedes-benz.coupe -> vehicle.mercedes.coupe`
- `vehicle.mini.cooperst -> vehicle.mini.cooper_s`
- `vehicle.lincoln.mkz2017 -> vehicle.lincoln.mkz_2017`
- `vehicle.mustang.mustang -> vehicle.ford.mustang`
- `vehicle.lincoln2020.mkz2020 -> vehicle.lincoln.mkz_2020`
- `vehicle.mercedesccc.mercedesccc -> vehicle.mercedes.coupe_2020`
- `vehicle.charger2020.charger2020 -> vehicle.dodge.charger_2020`
- `vehicle.chargercop2020.chargercop2020 -> vehicle.dodge.charger_police_2020`
- `vehicle.vespa.vespa -> vehicle.vespa.zx125`

## New and Improved Pedestrians

We welcome a diverse new set of pedestrians to the CARLA family. A new generation of pedestrians has been added to the [blueprint library](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bp_library/). The new pedestrians have a variety of body shapes and skin colors. Pedestrians all over the board have been improved with new shaders for skin, eyes, and clothing that add microdetail information. Meshes have been improved with a higher polygon count and better topology.

![pedestrians](/img/posts/2021-07-30/pedestrians.png){:class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block"}

Actors in the blueprint library now have an additional generation attribute to distinguish between old and new models when you spawn them. You can also set some flags in `generate_traffic.py` and `manual_control.py` that defines which generations you would like to spawn:

```sh
# In generate_traffic.py
# Generate first generation vehicles
--generationv 1

# Generate second generation walkers
--generationw 2

# In manual_control.py
# Generate all generations
--generation All
```

## OpenStreetMaps

Users can now enable the generation of traffic lights on junctions in OpenStreetMap maps through the Python API. Doing so is easy and only requires setting the [`generate_traffic_lights`](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Osm2OdrSettings.generate_traffic_lights) parameter to `True` in your code:

```py
# Define the settings.
settings = carla.Osm2OdrSettings()
# Enable traffic light generation from OSM data
settings.generate_traffic_lights = True
```

Most of the traffic light data will be extracted from OpenStreetMap metadata, but in some areas this information is sparse or unavailable. To work with this limitation, you can [enable](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Osm2OdrSettings.all_junctions_with_traffic_lights) all junctions to be controlled with traffic lights:

```py
settings.all_junctions_with_traffic_lights = True
```

To give you even more freedom, you can also [disable](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Osm2OdrSettings.set_traffic_light_excluded_way_types) certain kinds of roads from generating traffic lights, for example, motorway links:

```py
settings.set_traffic_light_excluded_way_types(["motorway_link"])
```

A full [list](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_api/#carla.Osm2OdrSettings.set_osm_way_types) of the types of roads you can filter by is found in the Python API.

## Python Client Library

There are now several options for installing the Python client library. The options available depend on whether you are building from source or using a packaged version of CARLA. The options include:

**A) `.egg` file - Available for source build and packaged version**

`.egg` files are a continuation of the option available in previous releases. Nothing has changed with this option. The `.egg` file does not need to be installed. All of CARLA's example scripts automatically look for this file when importing CARLA.

If you previously installed a CARLA `.whl`, the `.whl` will take precedence over an `.egg` file.

**B) `.whl` file - Available for the source build and packaged version**

The `.whl` file should be installed using `pip` or `pip3`, depending on your OS.

If you are using the source build version of CARLA, this `.whl` file cannot be distributed as it is built specifically for your OS during the build process.

**C) Downloadable Python package - package version only**

The CARLA client library can be downloaded from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/carla/). This library is compatible with Python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

The PyPi download is suitable for use with CARLA packages only. Since the PyPi download only contains the client library, it is most useful in situations where you will be communicating with a remote CARLA server where you do not require downloading a full CARLA package.

This change gives a lot of flexibility to users, but also adds some more complexity to the installation process. Make sure you read the installation guides carefully before you install CARLA!

## RLlib Integration

CARLA has integrated with the [Ray/RLlib library](https://github.com/ray-project/ray). Ray is an open-source framework that provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications. Ray is packaged with RLlib, a scalable reinforcement learning library, and Tune, a scalable hyperparameter tuning library. This integration allows for the easy use of the CARLA environment for training and inference purposes. It opens up a whole world of potential for you to explore and build upon your AD agents.

In the [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_G_rllib_integration/), we provide a full guide that shows how users can create and use CARLA as an environment of Ray and use that environment for training and inference purposes. There is an example experiment and you will find instructions that allow you to use the experiment code both locally and in the cloud using AWS.

## Chrono Integration (Beta)

CARLA has integrated with [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/), an open-source, multi-physics simulation engine that provides highly realistic vehicle dynamics using a template-based approach. This integration allows users to utilize Chrono templates to simulate vehicle dynamics while navigating a map.

Chrono is ready to use on CARLA packages but the source build needs to be compiled with the flag `ARGS="--chrono"`. You can find out more in the [documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tuto_G_chrono/). 

It is important to note that physics will revert back to CARLA control if a Chrono vehicle encounters a collision.

## spawn_npc.py Rename

The infamous `spawn_npc.py` script has been renamed as `generate_traffic.py`. Along with the renaming, there is an additional change that users should be aware of. The script now __works in synchronous mode by default__. This is to ensure that Traffic Manager performs at maximum quality and deterministically.  If you require the script to work in asynchronous mode, you can add the `-async` flag when you run it. 

## New Default Town

When you run your first simulation on 0.9.12 you may notice something different. Our new default map is the beautiful HD Town 10! Enjoy the spectacular views from our most complex and high-quality map!
