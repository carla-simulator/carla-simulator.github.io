The CARLA team is here, and it has a lot to say!  

In order to make it easier to keep up with all the changes in CARLA, the team has prepared a set of talks which cover a wide range of subjects. The talks have been uploaded to Youtube, and the slides are available to everybody for download.  

Let's take a look! 

##### General  
*   __Art improvements: environment and rendering__ — [video](https://youtu.be/ZZaHevsz8W8) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l9Ztaq0Q8fNN5YPU4-5vL13eZUwsQl5P/view?usp=sharing)  
Learn more about the evolution of graphics in CARLA, the process to achieve this, and the new parametrization of weather and lights.  
*   __Core implementations: synchrony, snapshots and landmarks__ — [video](https://youtu.be/nyyTLmphqY4) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yaOwf1419qWZqE1gTSrrknsWOhawEWh_/view?usp=sharing)  
Review of some important core elements of the API: the synchronous mode, simulation snapshots and everything about the new landmarks to access OpenDRIVE signals.  
*   __Data ingestion__ — [video](https://youtu.be/mHiUUZ4xC9o) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10uNBAMreKajYimIhwCqSYXjhfVs2bX31/view?usp=sharing)  
Follow an in-depth explanation of the automatic ingestion process for maps, and other assets, depending on how are you running CARLA (from a package or a build from source).  
*   __Pedestrians and their implementation__ — [video](https://youtu.be/Uoz2ihDwaWA) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tsosin7BLP1k558shtbzUdo2ZXVKy5CB/view?usp=sharing)  
Grasp everything regarding pedestrians, from navigation to animation, and the great upgrade to come.  
*   __Sensors in CARLA__ — [video](https://youtu.be/T8qCSet8WK0) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UO8ZAIOp-1xaBzcFMfn_IoipycVkUo4q/view?usp=sharing)  
Take notes on the full potential of some of the CARLA sensors and how to customize these.  

##### Modules  
*   __Improvements in the Traffic Manager__ — [video](https://youtu.be/n9cufaJ17eA) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R9uNZ6pYHSZoEBxs2vYK7swiriKbbuxo/view?usp=sharing)  
A detailed walkthrough for the TM module. Learn how to create traffic situations and the implementation details that allow their definition.  
*   __Integration of Autoware and ROS__ — [video](https://youtu.be/ChIgcC2scwU) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uO6nBaFirrllb08OeqGAMVLApQ6EbgAt/view?usp=sharing)  
Find out how does CARLA communicate with Autoware and ROS, and how the integration is achieved by creating bridges between those.  
*   __Introducing ScenarioRunner__ — [video](https://youtu.be/dcnnNJowqzM) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zgoH_kLOfIw117FJGm2IVZZAIRw9U2Q0/view?usp=sharing)   
Start creating scenarios and routes to train or validate your AD stacks using the ScenarioRunner module. 
*   __OpenSCENARIO support__ — [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6ATxZRTWEdstiZwfBN1_T_x_WwZs0zE/view?usp=sharing)  
Check the specifics for the support of the OpenSCENARIO standard in ScenarioRunner.  

##### Features  
*   __Co-Simulations with SUMO and PTV-Vissim__ — [video](https://youtu.be/PuFSbj1PU94) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DgMNUBqKqWBrdiwBiAIT4DdR9ObCquI/view?usp=sharing)  
Run a co-simulation with CARLA using different traffic simulators and profit from the best in each other.  
*   __Integration of RSS-lib__ — [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whREmrCv67fOMipgCk6kkiW4VPODig0A/view?usp=sharing)

*   __The External Sensor Interface (ESI)__ — [video](https://youtu.be/5hXHPV9FIeY) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VWFaEoS12siW6NtQDUkm44BVO7tveRbJ/view?usp=sharing)  
Catch up with the new simulator for electromagnetic sensors, a bet on accuracy and flexibility. 
*   __The OpenDRIVE Standalone Mode__ — [video](https://youtu.be/U25GhofVV1Q) | [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D5VsgfX7dmgPWn7UtDDid3-OdS1HI4pY/view?usp=sharing)  
Run your own maps in CARLA using nothing but a XODR file. Load huge maps with an automatically generated mesh for vehicles and walkers to navigate through.  

We hope these talks will ease the understanding of CARLA and what it has to offer. Having users' best interest in mind, we would like these talks to set the path for more CARLA content.  

For now, enjoy the talks! There is much more to come!
