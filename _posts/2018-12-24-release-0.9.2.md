title:  "CARLA 0.9.2: Upgraded ROS-bridge, Traffic scenario engine and a new Agent class to perform driving navigation from client side!"
subtitle: ""
description: "We have continued extending CARLA's eco-system and today we are proud to bring one of the most expected features, Scenario_Runner. A new framework based on py_trees to generate traffic situations in CARLA, aiming to train and verify Autonomous Driving agents. We also bring un upgrade of the ROS-bridge compatible with 0.9.X, so that now you can run your ROS agents in CARLA. These new features among many other bug fixes and interesting additions"

We end 2018 realising CARLA **0.9.2**! This release brings long-time awaited requests such as a new version of the ROS-bridge and new documentation and tutorials. It also introduces our new Scenario Runner, an engine to execute and evaluate agents in a variety of traffic situations. This is a critical piece in the development of CARLA towards achieving our goal of accelerating progress in Autonomous Driving R&D.

Time to have a look at the highlights of this release!


### Simulation of Traffic Scenarios

One of the key aspects of simulation in the field of Autonomous Driving is to explore and reproduce all those traffic situations that occur in real life, with the purpose of learning from them and at the same time to assess how AI algorithms cope with such situations.

> Figure 2. Example of traffic scenario: Ego-vehicle losing control due to road bad conditions.

![Scenario03](/img/posts/2018-12-24/scenario03.png){:class="img-fluid"}
> Figure 3. Example of traffic scenario: Adversarial vehicle running a red traffic light. Emergency brake needed.

To this end we have created [Scenario_Runner](https://github.com/carla-simulator/scenario_runner){:target="_blank"}, which serves as our new traffic scenarios engine built on top of the [py_trees](https://github.com/stonier/py_trees){:target="_blank"} library. These scenarios are defined following templates in a way that it is possible to reuse general atomic behaviors that emerge in multiple situations. In this release we include some of the basic [NHTSA pre-crash](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/pre-crash_scenario_typology-final_pdf_version_5-2-07.pdf){:target="_blank"} traffic scenarios:

* FollowLeadingVehicle: hero vehicle must react to the decelerations of a leading vehicle
* FollowLeadingVehicleWithObstacle: hero vehicle must react to a leading vehicle due to an obstacle blocking the road
* StationaryObjectCrossing: hero vehicle must react to a cyclist or pedestrian blocking the road
* DynamicObjectCrossing: hero vehicle must react to a cyclist or pedestrian suddenly crossing in front of it
* OppositeVehicleRunningRedLight: hero vehicle must avoid a collision at an intersection regulated by traffic lights when the crossing traffic runs a red light
* NoSignalJunctionCrossing: hero vehicle must cross a non-signalized intersection
* VehicleTurningRight: hero vehicle must react to a cyclist or pedestrian crossing ahead after a right turn
* VehicleTurningLeft: hero vehicle must react to a cyclist or pedestrian crossing ahead after a left turn

Implementing a traffic scenario can be done by following a simple recipe:

```
class MyScenario(BasicScenario):

    timeout = 60            # Timeout of scenario in seconds

    # ego vehicle parameters
    _ego_vehicle_model = 'vehicle.carlamotors.carlacola'
    _ego_vehicle_start = carla.Transform(
        carla.Location(...), carla.Rotation(yaw=0))


    def __init__(self, world, debug_mode=False):
        """
        Setup all relevant parameters and create scenario
        and instantiate scenario manager
        """

        super(MyScenario, self).__init__(
            name="ControlLoss",
            town="Town03",
            world=world,
            debug_mode=debug_mode)

    def _create_behavior(self):
		  ...
        return py_tree_sequence

    def _create_test_criteria(self):
        """
        A list of all test criteria will be created that is later used
        in parallel behavior tree.
        """
        criteria = []

        collision_criterion = CollisionTest(self.ego_vehicle)
        ...

        criteria.append(collision_criterion)
        criteria.append(reached_region_criterion)

        return criteria
```
These scenarios have some associated termination criteria that are used to automatic evaluate if the "hero" car performed as expected. Please, check out the examples to know more.

### Upgraded ROS Bridge

There is no doubt about [ROS](http://www.ros.org/){:target="_blank"} being the most used system to put together robotics solutions. Hundreds of teams use ROS around the world to create their autonomous agents. For this reason, we took very seriously the task of updating CARLA's ROS bridge to be fully compatible with the new 0.9.X branch. From 0.9.2 CARLA's ROS bridge will live in its own repository [here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge){:target="_blank"}.

### New Python Agents

New classes have been added to cope with vehicle navigation from client side in the form of agents. The first two of these agents are **BasicAgent** and **RoamingAgent**. BasicAgent is able to navigate to a point given location coordinates while dealing with other vehicles and traffic lights safely. RoamingAgent drives around making random choices when presented to multiple options.

```
agent = BasicAgent(world.vehicle)
            spawn_point = world.world.get_map().get_spawn_points()[0]
            agent.set_destination((spawn_point.location.x,
                                   spawn_point.location.y,
                                   spawn_point.location.z))
while True:
    control = agent.run_step()
    world.vehicle.apply_control(control)
```

These agents serve to present the basic ideas on how to implement more complex agents that will come soon. Try these agents out by running:

```
python PythonAPI/automatic_control.py
```

### New version of Town03

Town03 has been upgraded to include a setup of traffic lights that is compatible with US standards. For the first time in CARLA we have also included unsignalized intersection, where agents negotiations needs to occur in order to safely cross the intersection.

### New Documentation and Tutorials

Tutorials have been extended to cover relevant topics, such as how to use 0.9.X API or how to create new maps based on RoadRunner:

* Python 0.9.X API tutorial [link](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Docs/core_concepts.md)
* How to create new maps using RoadRunner [link](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Docs/tuto_A_add_map.md)

We will keep adding more tutorials periodically. Please, check our documentation folder [Docs](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/master/Docs) or the online documentation [here](https://carla.readthedocs.io) for further information.


#### Things missing

 * Full ***synchronous*** mode
 * Simulation of ***pedestrians***
 * ***GPU-accelerated*** LIDAR

These functionalities will be added very soon. We will keep improving this API in the coming releases. If you find any
issues or have suggestions that can be added, please do not hesitate to
share it with the community at our [GitHub][githubrepolink]{:target="_blank"} or
[Discord chat][discordlink]{:target="_blank"}. For the full list of methods available take a look at the [Python API Reference][apireflink]{:target="_blank"}.
